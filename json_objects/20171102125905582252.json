Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Pre-heat the oven to 200°c.Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.In the meantime, make the sauce.In a large, hot frying pan, fry the bacon until starting to crisp with most of the fat rendered.Pour off most of the fat then add the garlic and smoked paprika and fry for 30 seconds.Add all of the tomatoes and the sugar and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cream/yoghurt, parsley and seasoning.Cook the gnocchi in the salted water until it starts floating to the top.
