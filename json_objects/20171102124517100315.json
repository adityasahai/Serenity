Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Mazzei Chianti Classico Riserva Ser Lapo. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452096,"title":"Mazzei Chianti Classico Riserva Ser Lapo","description":"Ruby red with violet nuances, this wine has bright aromas of fresh cherries mingle with notes of thyme and subtle smoky nuances. In the mouth, this wine has a bright acid structure providing a lively quality. Cranberry, raspberry and red cherry dominate with hints of leather, cedar and cocoa powder. Some earthiness in the finish and ripe soft tannins.Pasta with meat sauces, stews, grilled meats and mid-aged cheeses.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452096-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/mazzei-chianti-classico-riserva-ser-lapo-2011/146710"}]},"instructions":"Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer. In the stand mixer bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Give a quick stir with a spoon, and then allow to sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.Add the flour, ½ cup herbs, 3 tablespoons oil, cheese, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed for 5 to 10 minutes until well combined. The dough will pull away from the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, and knead for about 5 minutes. (Emeril said to knead for 10 minutes and I couldn't do it, but my bread came out fine.)Form the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl. Roll the dough around a little so it's coated in the oil too. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 1 hour to let the dough double in size. Punch down the dough and recover; allow dough to sit for an additional hour, to double in size.Line a baking sheet with a Sil-Pat. (Emeril uses parchment paper lining dusted with cornmeal.)Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead it several times to form a ball. Dust a rolling pin with flour and roll the dough out to a 12\" x 16\" (or so) rectangle. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, and set aside. Allow dough to rise one last time for 1 hour.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.In a small bowl, combine remaining herbs with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Using your fingertips, dimple the top of the dough with indentations about ½\" deep. Brush the dough with the herb/oil mixture, save a little for after baking. Sprinkle dough with Kosher salt. Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the baking sheet back to front. Bake for an additional 6 minutes, or until golden. Reomove bread from oven, brush with remaining herb/oil. Serve hot or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer.
