A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Combine the sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Using your fingers, cut in the butter into crumbly. Mix the egg, heavy cream, and coconut extract in a separate bowl, then add to the dry ingredients and combine. Add in the toasted coconut and chocolate chips, mix until combined.Use your hands to form rounded scones, dividing the dough into equal sized scones. Place the scones on a baking sheet with a silpat and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the scones are slightly browning. Place the shredded coconut on a baking sheet, bake at 325 degrees F for 4-6 minutes, stirring to prevent burning. Coconut can burn easily, so keep an eye on it. Remove the pan from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Use your fingers to break the coconut into smaller pieces.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the sugar, flour, baking powder and salt.
