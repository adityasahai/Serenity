So all the flour and masala coat the all sliced onions. Adjust the besan quantity to coat the onions. Make sure all the sliced onion should be coated with flour.Leave it aside for 20 minutes. So onion will start to leave its water and flour mixture will get wet. We don’t want to make batter of flour so do not add any extra water. Water from onion is enough. Less water = crispy pakoda.Heat the oil (few inches deep) in the pan on medium heat for deep frying. Once oil is hot, add spoonful of pakoda mixture.Fry it till it becomes golden brown on both sides. Turn them around while frying for even cooking. Deep fry few pakodas at a time. Do not over crowd them.Then remove it on paper towel lined plate.
