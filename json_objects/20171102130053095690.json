With a rigid pastry blender, cut in the butter until crumbly. Press the dough on the bottom and up the sides of a 9\" pie pan, aiming for a uniform thickness all over. Do this with a gentle yet firm hand. Set aside.In a medium bowl, stir together the rhubarb, sugar, and flour. Pour over the pie crust and gently spread evenly across the bottom. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and set aside.Increase oven temperature to 350째.In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until creamy, about 1 minute or so. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Then add the vanilla and beat just to combine. Pour cream cheese mixture over the hot rhubarb in the pie pan. There will be accumulated liquid from the rhubarb, so gently spread the cream cheese evenly across the rhubarb, out to the outer crust. Bake for 25 minutes.While the cream cheese layer is baking, make the sour cream layer. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, sugar, and vanilla. Immediately after the cheesecake layer has baked for 25 minutes, spread the sour cream layer over the center of the pie, leaving about 1/2'' of the cream cheese layer exposed around the edges. Put the pie back in the oven and bake an additional 15 minutes.Let cool completely on a wire rack and then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
