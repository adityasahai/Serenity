White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degreesButterfly chicken breasts into thinner slices.Lightly brown each piece in hot oil for about 8-10 minutes.Place in 913 baking dish.Brush teriyaki sauce evenly over top of chicken, then cover evenly with Ranch dressing.Sprinkle cheese and bacon on top.Bake for 25-30 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Butterfly chicken breasts into thinner slices.Lightly brown each piece in hot oil for about 8-10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":5062,"name":"chicken breast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Place in 913 baking dish.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Brush teriyaki sauce evenly over top of chicken, then cover evenly with Ranch dressing.Sprinkle cheese and bacon on top.","ingredients":[{"id":6112,"name":"teriyaki sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":1041009,"name":"cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cheddar-cheese.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Bake for 25-30 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
