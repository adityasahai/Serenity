Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2.  In a large bowl, mix spinach, cheeses, eggs, salt and pepper.  Stir together until well blended.3.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of marinara sauce in a 9x13-inch pan.  Spread it around to cover the bottom.4.  Place the mixed filling into a plastic bag.  You can use either a frosting piping bag or a gallon zip bag.  Snip the corner, gather the top and squeeze the filling into the corner.  Hold an uncooked manicotti shell in your hand and squeeze the filling inside the shell.  Let it overflow on both sides.  Place the filled shell into the sauce-lined pan.  Repeat with remaining manicotti and fill the pan with the stuffed shells, until you run out of shells and filling.  You should be able to fill 12 to 14 shells- if you run out of room in your pan, use a separate smaller pan to accommodate the extra.5.  Cover the pasta with marinara sauce, using about 2 1/2 cups of sauce.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup Romano/Parmesan on top.  At this point, you can cover with foil and refrigerate until you're ready to bake, or you can cover with foil and place it in the oven immediately.6.  Bake, covered with foil, 50 minutes.  Remove foil and bake an additional 10 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2.
