Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Prepare spaghetti according to package instructions.In a large skillet add the coconut oil and sliced pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic cloves and broccoli slaw and cook for another 3 minutes or so. Add the coconut cream, pasta water, curry paste, soy sauce and peanut butter. With a wire whisk, whisk until the peanut butter dissolves and the sauce is properly combined with the veggies.Add the fresh spinach and chopped peanuts and incorporate well. Turn heat off and toss the cooked pasta with the sauce. Serve while still warm.Note: I used 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water because I used coconut cream. If you use coconut milk you may need just 1-2 tbsp of the reserved pasta water.Recipe adapted from Momtastic","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare spaghetti according to package instructions.In a large skillet add the coconut oil and sliced pepper.
