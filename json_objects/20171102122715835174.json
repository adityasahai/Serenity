Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 56 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":445451,"title":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"Shows dark plum/garnet with some amber and orange at the edge. The nose shows roasted herbs and meatiness with some background notes of sweet cherry, truffle and vegetal qualities. This is a distinctive Pinot Noir with aromatics that are very old-world. In the mouth the wine has always had a certain austerity but a bit of a gap in the middle. The wine has held up nicely over time but has never really developed the sweetness and charm that we would expect of our best Pinot Noirs.","price":"$55.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445451-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/beaux-freres-the-beaux-freres-vineyard-pinot-noir-1996/126352"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Fill a large bowl with warm soapy water. Add tomatillos and agitate and rub away any sticky film on their skin. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Blot dry with a clean towel. Toss tomatillos, jalapeno, canola and ¾ teaspoon salt in a large roasting pan. Roast until the tomatoes are soft and starting to burst open, 20 to 25 minutes. Scrape tomatillos and juice into blender. Add cilantro, avocado, garlic and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Puree until smooth. Alternatively, if blender is too small, puree in two batches mixing together the two batches in a bowl. Chill before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
