Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                        Shell and devein shrimp. Wash them thoroughly, and set aside.                                                                            Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan, and add onions. Over high heat, fry the onions until they turn golden brown (about 10 minutes) , stirring constantly to prevent burning. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic, ginger, and chilies, and fry for an additional 2 minutes. Add turmeric and coriander, stir rapidly for 15 seconds, and add coconut milk and salt. Cook the sauce, uncovered, until it thickens (about 10 minutes). Stir frequently to ensure that the sauce does not stick and burn.                                                                            Add shrimp, mix, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered, for 57 minutes, or until the shrimp is cooked through. Do not overcook the shrimp, or they will become tough and chewy. Check for salt, stir in minced cilantro leaves, and serve.                                    NoteThis dish has a lot of gravy and must be served with rice. Best, of course, is plain cooked rice; then all the flavors can be enjoyed without any interference from the pilaf spices.                            From Classic Indian Cooking  1980 by Julie Sahni.
