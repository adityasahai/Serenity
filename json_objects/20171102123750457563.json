A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Catherman's Port with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428212,"title":"NV Catherman's Port","description":null,"price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428212-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/NV-Cathermans-Port-750-mL/dp/B00GT0AZ50"}]},"instructions":"Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat, add the tea bags and let steep 5 minutes. Remove the tea bags (do not squeeze). Let the tea cool to room temperature.                          Meanwhile, bring 3 tablespoons water, the sugar and ginger to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool; discard the ginger. Stir the ginger syrup into the tea. Pour into ice cube trays and freeze until solid, 2 to 4 hours. Freeze the chopped melon until solid, at least 2 hours.                          Combine half each of the tea ice cubes, frozen melon, ginger ale, lemon juice and mint in a blender and puree until smooth. Divide between 2 glasses.
