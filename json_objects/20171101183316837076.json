Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is NV Mindbender Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and white pepper. Place the flour in a zipper lock bag. Add the chicken to the bag and shake to coat. Shake off excess flour. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add margarine. When the margarine is melted, add the chicken pieces in batches, browning on all sides until a light brown crust forms (about 10-12 minutes per batch).Remove chicken to a plate. Add carrot, onion, and celery to the same skillet. Cook the vegetables until they begin to soften and the onion is soft and translucent, about 6-8 minutes. Add the paprika and garlic, cooking an additional 1-2 minutes until the garlic becomes fragrant. Add the white wine and scrape any browned bits sticking to the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken to the pan and add the stock and bay leaf. Bring to a near boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer.Simmer on low heat, partially covered (about 40-45 minutes) until the chicken is tender and the meat closest to the thighbone is no longer pink. Remove the chicken and discard the bay leaf. Allow the liquid to cool slightly. Gradually stirr in 1/4 of the sour cream. Add the remaining sour cream and stir gently to combine. Return the chicken to the sauce and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and white pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the flour in a zipper lock bag.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the chicken to the bag and shake to coat.
