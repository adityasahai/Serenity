White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Place all ingredients in a 2 quart saucepan.  Bring to a slow boil, stir to combine all ingredients, reduce heat and simmer until mixture has reduced by two thirds volume.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve to remove fennel seeds.  Store in a squeeze bottle or other airtight container until ready to serve.If stored in a squeeze bottle, reheat by placing bottle in a pot full of warm water for a few minutes or microwave on medium for about 30 seconds.Makes approximately 1/4 cup.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Season both sides of chicken liberally with salt and pepper.  Heat a large oven proof skillet over medium flame.  Add olive oil and swirl to coat pan.  Place chicken carefully in skillet and sear on both sides (approximately 3 minutes per side.) Place skillet in preheated oven and cook for 15 – 20 minutes or until juices run clear.Remove from heat and rest, covered loosely in aluminum foil for at least 10 minutes.Mix olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper together in a large bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and toss well, making sure to coat the apples well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but no longer than one hour.  toss lightly before serving.Place approximately 1/2 cup of the salad on a serving plate.  Slice a chicken breast into 5 1-inch sections and carefully lay over one side of the salad.  Drizzle the chicken with approximately 1 tsp. of the reduction.  Drizzle another 2 tsp. of reduction decoratively around the plate.
