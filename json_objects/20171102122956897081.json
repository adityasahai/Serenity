The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. The Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus. The natural acidity gives this wine a perfect balance that is refreshingly crisp and leaves your mouth watering. A perfect party wine, or can be enjoyed with a variety of foods from seafood and poultry to oriental food and fresh salads.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434166-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/schmitt-sohne-relax-riesling-2008/99841"}]},"instructions":"In a medium pan over high heat, bring water and rice to a boil.
