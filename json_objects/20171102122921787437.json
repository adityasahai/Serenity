in a pot large enough to hold them all, and fill with enough water to cover the chicken by about 1-2-inches. Add 2 bay leaves to the water and bring to a boil over high heat.When the water comes to a boil, cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the chicken for 10-15 minutes, or until cooked through.Using tongs, remove the chicken and set on a plate. When it is cool enough to touch, shred it and set aside. (Note: If you have a stand mixer, you can use the paddle attachment to shred the chicken, and it's so much faster/easier than doing it yourself!)While chicken is boiling, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced peppers and onions and cook for 6-8 minutes until the onions begin to get translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.Sprinkle the flour over the cooked vegetables, stir to coat, then whisk in the chicken broth. Cook for 6-8 minutes until the mixture begins to thicken.Reduce the heat to low and stir in the diced tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper.Turn the heat off and remove the skillet from the hot burner, then stir in the Greek yogurt and the shredded chicken into the skillet. Squeeze in the juice of 1 lime and stir.Tear up the tortillas by hand into bite size pieces (about 32 pieces each), and place half of them on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Pour the chicken mixture on top of the tortillas and spread the remaining half of the tortillas on top of the chicken. Evenly sprinkle the cheese over the top and bake for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 F and spray a 13x9-inch casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404635,"name":"casserole dish","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/casserole-dish.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the chicken in a pot large enough to hold them all, and fill with enough water to cover the chicken by about 1-2-inches.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 bay leaves to the water and bring to a boil over high heat.When the water comes to a boil, cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low.
