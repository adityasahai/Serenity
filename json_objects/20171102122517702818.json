picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Black River Winery Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430352,"title":"Black River Winery Merlot","description":null,"price":"$10.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430352-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2009-Black-River-Winery-Merlot/dp/B00ED59310"}]},"instructions":"In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, garlic, pineapple juice, olive oil, curry, red pepper flakes, cayenne, ginger, sesame oil, coconut cream, rice vinegar, and brown sugar.
