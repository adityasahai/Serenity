Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441154,"title":"King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris","description":"Light straw with emerald green hue.
