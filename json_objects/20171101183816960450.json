the menu? Try pairing with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Clos Du Val Merlot. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 30 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":433037,"title":"Clos Du Val Merlot","description":"A dense, inky color and rich aromas of intense black currant and blackberry pervade our 2002 Merlot. Hints of herbs, black olives and toast are also present in the nose, leading to a well-structured wine with an abundance of dark red and black fruit flavors, balanced with sweet toast and some spice. The wine's soft tannins, lingering finish, and rich, complex taste make this a delightful accompaniment to roast chicken, pork, or beef.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433037-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/clos-du-val-merlot-2002/83430"}]},"instructions":"Whisk all the ingredients together for the sauce in a small bowl and set aside.Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
