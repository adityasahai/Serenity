(The mixture may steam, but do not let it boil.) Remove the mixture from the heat and pour it into a small bowl. Let it cool to roughly 100F.While the milk is cooling, place the warm water in a large bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let is set until the yeast begins to foam.Add the beaten eggs and cooled milk mixture to the yeast, stirring to combine.Add white wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour, stirring to form a soft dough.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter top and begin kneading the dough, adding the last cup of flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the counter. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes. Your final dough should be soft, smooth and slightly tacky, but it should not stick to your hands or the counter as you knead.Place the dough in a clean, well-greased bowl. Cover it with a damp tea towel and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 40-45 minutes.While the dough is rising, mix the chopped apples with brown sugar, vanilla and spices in a large bowl. Set aside.Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured counter top. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and shape each piece into a snake, roughly 1 inch in diameter. Cut the dough into roughly 1 inch pieces. Toss a few pieces at a time with the apple mixture and place the coated pieces in a well-greased bundt pan. (Be sure to incorporate some of the apple chunks with the bread pieces in the pan.) Continue until all the dough and filling have been used. (You will not fill the pan completely.)Cover the ban with your tea towel and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in bulk, 30-35 minutes.Near the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 350F.Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, until the top is golden and firm when tapped. A thermometer inserted into the center of the bread should read 180F.Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, until the pan is cool to the touch.Invert the pan over a cooling rack and gently shake to remove the bread. If it sticks, insert a knife, gently along the sides of the pan and use it to separate the bread from the pan.Place 1 cup of sugar a large saucepan (larger than you would ever think you would need). Heat the sugar over medium heat. DO NOT STIR the sugar, until the edges start to melt. After that point, you can stir the sugar occasionally to aid the melting process. (This will take about 15 minutes, be patient.)While the sugar is melting heat the wine in a small saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until it has reduced by half. Remove from the heat.Once your sugar has completely melted, reduce the heat to medium low and continue to cook it to a deep golden/amber color. (This will take about 10 minutes.)Once the sugar has reached that beautiful dark caramel color, remove it from the heat. Gently pour the wine reduction into the caramelized sugar, drizzling it down the side of the pan. Your sugar will bubble, sputter and steam (all of the water and alcohol in the wine is instantly coming to a boil because the sugar is so hot). Your sugar will turn into a solid mass.Heat your sugar and wine mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has melted again and the mixture begins to thicken, 15-20 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat and mix in butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth.Store any un-used caramel sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. The caramel sauce will harden in the fridge, soften it by heating for a few seconds at a time in the microwave.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, heat milk, sugar, butter and salt over medium heat, until the sugar and butter have dissolved.
