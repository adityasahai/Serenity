Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Tiamo Chianti with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441645,"title":"Tiamo Chianti","description":"Intense ruby red with garnet tones.

Plunge the spinach into the same pan, then immediately drain through a colander and shake off any excess water. Put the crème fraîche in a small ovenproof dish with the grated parmesan. Add the hot, drained gnocchi and spinach and give everything a good stir. Crumble the blue cheese over and season with ground pepper. Slide the dish under a hot grill until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the gnocchi in a large pan of boiling water according to pack instructions.
