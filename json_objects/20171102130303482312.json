Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438867,"title":"Chateau Ste.

For the clams casino: In a saute pan over medium-low heat, add the olive oil, garlic, shallots and some salt. Sweat the aromatics for 5 minutes. Add the pickling liquid and wine, and bring to a simmer. Add the clams and cover until the clams open, 5 minutes.                          Remove the clams and set aside. Take the meat out of the shells, chop them and toss back into the sauce with the butter and 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs to tighten up the mixture, adding more to thicken, if needed. Add some black pepper and reduce the cooking liquid slightly.                          Add the bacon to a saute pan and cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and crumble. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease in the pan. Add the remaining 1/2 cup panko into the same saute pan and toast over medium-low heat until the breadcrumbs are crispy and lightly browned.                          For the sandwich build: On a slice of baguette, spread some of the lemon parsley mayo and pile a generous amount of the clams casino mixture on top. Garnish with crumbled bacon, toasted panko, cherry pepper slices and parsley leaves before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the mayo","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the mayonnaise, parsley, lemon juice, lemon zest and some salt and pepper to a bowl, and mix by hand until combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"For the clams casino: In a saute pan over medium-low heat, add the olive oil, garlic, shallots and some salt.
