Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448227,"title":"Tramin Pinot Grigio","description":"Bright yellow in color with coppery reflections and clear fruit aromas of pear, citrus, honeysuckle, tropical fruits and light spices.

Squeeze a touch of lemon juice on each pile of greens.Lay 2 ounces of the smoked salmon on top of the greens.Cut the avocado in half lengthwise.  Remove the pit from the avocado and discard.  Remove the avocado from the skin, place the avocado on a cutting board, and cut into thin slices.  Put the avocado slices on top of the smoked salmon and add another squeeze of lemon juice.Crack an egg into a small prep bowl.  Carefully slip the egg from the prep bowl into the poaching water.  With a spoon, nudge the egg white together so the egg remains as close together as possible.  Repeat this for the remaining 3 eggs.Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and turn off the heat.  Let the eggs cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then carefully remove each egg with a slotted spoon, letting any excess water drip off.
