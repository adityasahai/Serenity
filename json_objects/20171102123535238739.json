Try pairing with Lambrusco, Chenin Blanc, and Riesling. With rich, cheesy mac & cheese you'll want to cleanse the palate with something crisp and acidic. We recommend Chenin Blanc, Riesling, or dry Lambrusco if you're in the mood for a red. The PRONTO Lambrusco Secco with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428385,"title":"PRONTO Lambrusco Secco","description":"Crimson purple color. Aromas are rich with purple iris, clove and licorice.

Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sauce to drizzle over the fried mac and cheese balls.Add cooked macaroni to the rest of the cheese sauce, stirring well. Taste for seasoning and add a little more salt if desired.Pour mixture into a greased 8x8-inch pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Too much longer and it will be hard to shape into balls.Use a small ice cream scoop to form balls. You will need to use your hands some to shape them. You should get about 16 balls. Place in a baking pan lined with wax paper and freeze for about 2 hours.Whisk together egg and one cup of milk in a bowl.Place one cup of flour in a bowl.Combine bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon salt in a third bowl.One at a time coat ball in flour, then in egg mixture. Coat with bread crumb mixture, then back in egg mixture and 1 more time in bread crumbs. Let balls sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes, while you heat up the oil. You want them to thaw some so that they will get warm all the way through.Heat oil to 350 degrees. Fry 4 to 5 balls at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown.Drain on paper towels. If desired, place them in a 200 degree oven to keep warm.Heat the 2 tablespoons of cheese sauce that was set aside. Place in a plastic bag.
