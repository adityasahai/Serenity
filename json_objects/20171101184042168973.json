Fruity, low tannin zinfandel is great for any sticky, saucy barbecue chicken dish. If you're not feeling red wine, a sparkling rosé will work too. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County San Joaquin County Zinfandel with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428933,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County San Joaquin County Zinfandel","description":"Our Ghost Pines Zinfandel blends fruit from San Joaquin, Sonoma and Lake counties to accentuate the best of what each of these phenomenal Zinfandel-producing counties has to offer. The 2014 Zinfandel opens with rich, complex aromas of ripe raspberry jam, cracked pepper and toasty oak. On the palate, the wine offers intense, jammy flavors of black cherry, boysenberry, brown spice and cola framed by lush structure and a long, multi-layered finish.","price":"$26.65","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428933-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Pines-Sonoma-Joaquin-Zinfandel/dp/B01A8WOUNC"}]},"instructions":"In a medium size saucepan mix together all the barbeque sauce ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium high heat, reduce heat to simmer and cook uncovered until mixture starts to thicken. (About 20 minutes – if you want extra sauce for dipping double the recipe and set half the sauce aside)In a small bowl combine all the ingredients for the spice rub.Preheat grill on high heat – while grill is heating pat chicken dry and rub the pieces with the spices; getting some of it under the skin whenever possible.Clean and oil the grill grates, turn all burners off except for the primary burner trying to maintain an indirect heat of 350F after the grill is closed. (I have a 4 burner grill for me I need to have the primary burner on high with the second one at about half)Place the chicken skin side down on the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook until skin starts to brown. (About 30 minutes depending on the temperature) uncover the grill, flip the chicken, and move the pieces closer to the burners brushing with the barbeque sauce. Flip and coat the chicken every few minutes until chicken is sticky, move the chicken over the direct heat, continue flipping and brushing the chicken with the sauce until chicken is well glazed and has a slight char. Remove the chicken from the grill when the internal temperature is reached of 160F. for the breasts, and 175 for thighs and legs.Place the chicken on a serving platter, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest 10 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium size saucepan mix together all the barbeque sauce ingredients.
