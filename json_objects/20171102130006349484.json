Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm spot for about 15 minutes.Add the eggs, honey, salt and stir, then add remaining 3.5 cups flour to the mixture. Mix until well incorporated and then transfer to a lightly floured surfaced.As you knead add the 1/4 cup softened butter to the dough and continue kneading, adding flour to reduce stickiness when needed until the dough is smooth - 7 to 10 minutes.Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled - about 1.5 to 2 hours.Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Roll out into a large rectangle and brush with 1.5 Tbsp melted butter.Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the butter and then starting at the long side covered with sugar, roll up the rectangle as tightly as you can and pinch the seam together as the dough allows.With the seam facing down, cut into 15-18 equal pieces (~ 2 inches), depending on how tall you want them. Place the rolls in the dish and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in the refrigerator overnight. Rinse your bowl for making the glaze in the morning.In the morning remove rolls from the refrigerator and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake until golden brown, about 20-30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes.While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze: Melt butter in your mixing bowl and then whisk in the milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Whisk until a smooth paste forms adding more sugar as needed. Spread the glaze over the warm rolls and serve immediately. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for several days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle the yeast over warm water and allow to bloom for a few minutes, then whisk until smooth, adding in 1/2 cup of the flour.
