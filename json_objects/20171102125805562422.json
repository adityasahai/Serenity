After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 58 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435309,"title":"Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot","description":"This wine shows aromas of sweet plum sauce, vanilla, chocolate, cedar and butterscotch with big, forward black cherry and black berry fruit in the mouth. A balanced middle with a hint of toasty oak is paired with a nice bite from rounded tannins, and a long pleasant finish. This wine pairs well with grilled meats and wild game with herb-infused, wild-berry sauces, hearty pasta dishes and Pacific Northwest Salmon.","price":"$57.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435309-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/duckhorn-napa-valley-merlot-1995/26649"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat a large pan to medium/high heat. Add 1 Tbsp oil, place steaks in pan and Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. Cook for minutes then add the slices onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms and saute for 2-3 minutes or until the onions are lightly browned. Don't overcook the meat and veggies because they will still cook in the oven. With a rolling pin, roll the dough of one loaf into an approximate 9 X 13 inch rectangle. Pour the steak mixture in the center make sure you leave about ½ inch of the dough edges plain so the dough will stick when you roll it). Layer the cheese on the steak mixture then Fold in the sides and tuck and roll the loaf.  Place the loaf, seam side down on a greased baking sheet or aluminum foil. Beat one egg and brush the outside of the loaves until completely covered with the egg, cut thin 2 inch strips on the top layer of the dough. Bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown. Cut and serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce. I like to use ranch or marinara.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a large pan to medium/high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 1 Tbsp oil, place steaks in pan and Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper.
