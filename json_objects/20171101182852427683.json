You will need to season much more than you think.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat, and when the oil shimmers, sear the meat for 2 minutes on the first side.  Turn the meat over, then add the butter, rosemary, and garlic, and brown the second side for another 2 minutes.As it browns, tilt the pan and use a spoon to baste the top of the meat with the rosemary garlic butter.  Transfer the meat to the rack and place the rosemary and garlic clove on top.Roast the meat for 45 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 135 degrees F.
