Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Selvapiana Chianti Rufina with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436167,"title":"Selvapiana Chianti Rufina","description":"This is a big and juicy Chianti Rufina, offering delicious strawberry and cherry aromas followed by subtle notes of spice box, leather, earth and mushrooms.
