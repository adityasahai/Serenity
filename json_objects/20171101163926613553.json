Place the tomatoes in a large pot or Dutch oven with 6 tablespoons water. Dampen a large piece of crumpled parchment paper with cold water, open it, and place it directly over the tomatoes. Cover the pot and cook over very low heat for 30 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally to stir. Do not open, as the tomatoes are sweating and cooking in their own steam.2. Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor, in two to three batches if necessary, and process until smooth. Strain through a sieve, discarding the skins and seeds, if desired. Place the tomatoes, olive oil, shallots, garlic, and herbs in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes, until reduced to 12 cups. Season with salt and pepper to taste, adding the sugar if necessary.3. To freeze: Allow the sauce to cool completely to room temperature, then divide among six 1-quart plastic freezer bags—each bag will contain about 2 cups of sauce, making each bag only half full. Freeze flat until solid, about 1 hour. When solid, store more compactly in the freezer.4. To thaw: Thaw the bags of sauce completely immersed in a bowl of cold water, about 1 1/2 hours to partially thaw. Or put the bags of sauce on a plate and thaw in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. You do not have to completely thaw the sauce before you heat it.5. To serve: Transfer the thawed sauce to a pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. If only partially thawed, simmer for an extra 5 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the tomatoes in a large pot or Dutch oven with 6 tablespoons water.
