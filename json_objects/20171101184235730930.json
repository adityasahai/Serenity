A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Cut Crisco into flour mixture with a pastry blender or fork until shortening pieces are the size of a pea. Add egg, water & vinegar and work dough into a ball. Flatten into a disc, double wrap with plastic wrap & let sit in the freezer for 10 minutes.Remove pie crust from freezer & roll out to about 1/4\" thickness on a floured surface. Cut out at least 15 stars (30 is better and uses about half the crust). Place stars & extra pie crust onto an un-greased baking sheet. Sprinkle tops with cinnamon sugar & bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 to 15 minutes or until light brown. Remove from oven & cool completely.Meanwhile, to make the blueberry pie filling: Combine the sugar & cornstarch together and pour it over blueberries in a small saucepan. Stir. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles and becomes thick.  Allow to COOL completely in the refrigerator.  REPEAT the process with strawberries in a separate saucepan. (If you have two saucepans you can make both fillings at the same time.)For the whipped cream cheese: Place cream cheese & sugar into a medium sized bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until sugar dissolves.  Add cool whip & beat on high until the beaters leave ripples in the cream cheese mixture. Keep cold until ready to assemble.To assemble: Place all fillings in separate zip-top bags.  Cut off one corner from each bag to be able to pipe the filling into the cups.  Break up the pie crust, except the stars, to make crumbs. In small, clear, 5 oz plastic cups, layer with crumbs, blueberry pie filling, whipped cream cheese, and strawberry pie filling. Place stars on the very top layer for decoration.
