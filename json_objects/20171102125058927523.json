Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet. Fresh and fruity, very clean and crisp.Tiamo Pinot Grigio pairs well with a wide array of lighter cuisine, especially fish/shellfish, poultry, pastas in cream sauce and softer cheeses. It's also an ideal aperitif.","price":"$8.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438682-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/tiamo-pinot-grigio-2008/98091"}]},"instructions":"If your shrimp haven't been cleaned, pull the tails off and run the tip of your knife into the curve of the shrimp to pull out that weird dark stringy thing. That's the digestive tract. You don't want to eat that. Toss in a couple generous pinches of salt and mix them around.Heat the butter/oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Add shrimp to skillet and cook until shrimp has just barely turned pink all over. It only takes a few minutes. Remove from heat and let them cool for a few minutes.Place the shrimp in the food processor with the avocado half, pesto, and lemon juice. Pulse until everything is chopped finely and combined thoroughly. Taste, and adjust salt as necessary. You may want this slightly salty to compensate for the cucumber coming later. Cut the ends off the cucumber, then slice them as thin as you can with a mandoline slicer. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the shrimp filling onto 3/4 of each cucumber slice. Starting at the filling end, roll it up and secure with a toothpick. You should have 16-18 cucumber rolls.Chill until ready to serve.Nat's Notes:1. Store-bought basil pesto contains cheese. You can make your own basil pesto and simply leave out the cheese if it bothers you. Just combine 2 cups of basil leaves, 1/3 cup pinenuts, 2 cloves garlic, 1-2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and salt to taste in a food processor. Pulse to chop finely. While the machine is running, pour in 3/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil. Process until smooth.2. Don't make these more than 2-3 hours before you eat them. They'll start to get watery.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If your shrimp haven't been cleaned, pull the tails off and run the tip of your knife into the curve of the shrimp to pull out that weird dark stringy thing.
