Chowder can benefit from a crisp white to cut through the rich, creamy broth - or you can go big or go home with a rich, buttery chardonnay. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Soak the clams in cold water for 30 minutes. The clams should all be tightly closed. Discard any damaged clams. Drain the water and scrub each of the clams with a brush. Cover the clams with fresh cold water again and let them soak while you prep the rest of the ingredients.Place the clams in a large, heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven and pour enough fresh water over them to cover the clams, about 4 cups. Bring the water to a boil and cook the clams for about 5 minutes, just until they open up. In about 2-3 minutes, they should start to open up, so start scooping out the ones that open up and by the time the clams cook for 5-7 minutes, they should all be open. If some don't open, discard them. Strain the clam juice through a fine mesh sieve lined with a paper towel and reserve it.Take the clams out of the shells and cut them into bite sized pieces.Instead of fresh clams, you can use canned clams and bottled clam juice.Wash out the dutch oven and return it to the stove. Add the bacon to the pot and cook it on medium low heat until the bacon is crisp and golden. Remove the bacon and set it to the side.Discard all of the bacon grease except for 2 Tablespoons. Add the onion, celery and jalapeo to the bacon grease and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Season with a small amount of salt (since the bacon grease is salty) and ground black pepper.Add the flour to the cooked vegetables and stir it in, cooking for about a minute, until the flour is evenly distributed among the vegetables.Pour in the reserved clam juice plus an additional 2 cups of water, scraping the bottom of the dutch oven to scrape all the brown bits and making sure the flour is dissolved. Bring it to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the potatoes, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, then taste the broth to see if it needs more salt. Cook, covered, at a simmer for about 10-15 minutes, just until the potatoes are cooked through.Add the fresh corn and the clams, cooking for another 3-5 minutes, just enough for the clams to cook through.Pour in the heavy cream, stir to combine and add the fresh herbs.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Soak the clams in cold water for 30 minutes.
