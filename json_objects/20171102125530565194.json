Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"InstructionsIf your fish fillets are rather large (I had three fillets that totaled a kilo in weight), cut them into serving size pieces. Score the flesh on one side by making slashes about a quarter of an inch deep. Score in two directions so that you have diamond patterns on the fish flesh. It isn’t just to make them look pretty — scoring them this way helps make them really crisp on the surface but still able to catch a lot of the sauce.Lightly sprinkle the fish with salt. Don’t overdo it because the sauce contains fish sauce which is also salty.Crush, peel and chop the garlic. How coarse or how fine the pieces is up to you.Thinly slice the chilis. I removed the seeds but you can choose not to — see tips — if you want a spicier sauce.Heat the cooking oil until it starts to smoke. Deep fry the fish in batches until lightly browned and crisp. I timed this stage and a batch consisting of three fillets were done in eight minutes flat. But, of course, the cooking time depends on how hot your cooking oil is and how much cooking oil you’re using. If you don’t use enough cooking oil and you have to flip the fish over, the cooking time will be longer. In my case, I had enough cooking oil in the wok so that all the fish fillets were totally submerged in oil. No flipping necessary.When the fish are nicely browned and crisp, drain them on paper towels then arrange on a serving platter.Pour off the oil until only about two tablespoonfuls remain. Over medium heat, fry the garlic and chilis just until fragrant, about a minute. Pour in the fish sauce and add the sugar, stirring constantly. Don’t take too long with this stage. With the little liquid and the amount of sugar, the mixture will burn fast with prolonged contact with the heat. As soon as the sauce thickens and the sugar is dissolved, turn off the heat.Pour the sauce over the fish and serve at once.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If your fish fillets are rather large (I had three fillets that totaled a kilo in weight), cut them into serving size pieces.
