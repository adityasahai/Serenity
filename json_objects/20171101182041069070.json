Cook for 2 minutes, then add the carrots, the zucchini, and the Serrano. Cook for another 4-5 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender. Add 3 tablespoons of the almonds and cook for about 1 more minute, to toast them lightly.

Pour in the coconut milk, the water, and the remaining teaspoon of salt. Return the heat to high, bring to a boil, give it one more stir, then cover and place in the oven.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Bake for 25 minutes, until the water is fully absorbed.
