Also chop your scallions and parsley just so they are ready.2) For the fresh green beans, snap off the ends and remove any \"strings\" down the center. Blanch the bean in boiling, salted water for 4 minutes. Drain the beans and immediately move them to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.3) For dressing, whisk together ingredients in a medium bowl, drizzling in the olive oil last. It should emulsify into a tangy vinaigrette.4) Add the dressing to the salad along with the blanched green beans.5) Season with salt and pepper and you can serve this right away but I think it's best if it chills in the fridge for an hour or two.
