While the blueberries are roasting, heat a dry skillet over medium high heat, then add the walnut halves, maple syrup and salt, stirring to coat. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the syrup thickens and coats the nuts. Transfer the nuts to a sheet of parchment paper to cool. Using a stand mixer, electric handheld mixer, or - if you have more endurance than me - a whisk, beat the whipping cream together with the vanilla extract and maple syrup until soft peaks form.Gently fold the cooled roasted blueberries into the maple whipped cream just until the contrasting colors begin to swirl together.
