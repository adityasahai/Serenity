Add the brown sugar, then stir to combine. Let heat for about 30-60 additional seconds, until the mixture is beginning to bubble and a bit more of the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, then stir in the cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, espresso powder, and vanilla. Let cool for a few minutes, until the batter feels warm but not uncomfortably hot when touched with your finger.Whisk in the eggs one at a time, fully incorporating between each addition and stirring until the mixture is shiny. Add the whole wheat flour, stirring until the batter is smooth once more, then stir in the chocolate chips. Set aside.For the pumpkin cheesecake batter: In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and pumpkin together until smooth and no lumps remain. Beat in the granulated sugar, all purpose flour and spices until smooth and combined. Beat in the vanilla and egg.Spoon half of the brownie batter into the prepared skillet.
