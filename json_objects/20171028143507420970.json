Cool cupcakes in pan for about 20 minutes before removing and placing on wire rack to cool completely.Once cool, use a small paring knife to hollow out the middle of the cupcake. This can really be as big and deep as you like, just make sure not to go all the way to the edge or bottom so you leave enough cupcake intact to hold its shape. Fill the center of the cupcakes with caramel. Replace the middle of the cake. Some caramel will ooze out; that is okay.Make the frosting. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and water over medium heat, stirring frequently until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once this happens, stop stirring, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, and allow the mixture to come to 238 degrees F on the thermometer. In the meantime, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high until foamy. Once foamy, add the cream of tartar and continue beating on medium-high until stiff peaks form. Be sure not to overwhip the egg whites or they will become dry.Once the eggs are whipped and the syrup is at 238, turn the eggs to medium-low, immediately remove the syrup from the heat, and begin slowly and steadily drizzling it into the eggs. If the syrup is ready before the eggs, it can be turned down or removed from the heat while the eggs finish, before being replaced on the heat to bring to temperature. If the eggs are ready before the syrup, stop mixing them until the syrup is almost ready. Turn them back to medium-high briefly before turning them back down and adding the syrup.Once the syrup has all been added, turn the mixer back to medium and beat the frosting (what is basically marshmallow cr\xe8me and is delectable all by itself) for 10-13 minutes until the bottom of the bowl is barely warm or at room temperature. It is important for it to not be too warm or the next step will not work.Once cooled, add the butter a couple tablespoons at a time, allowing each addition to incorporate before adding another. Scrape down the bowl occasionally. Once all the butter is incorporated add the vanilla and mix to combine. With the mixer running on low, add the caramel.', u'length': {u'number': 58, u'unit': u'minutes'}, u'number': 6, u'ingredients': [{u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg', u'id': 18373, u'name': u'cream of tartar'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg', u'id': 1124, u'name': u'egg whites'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg', u'id': 2050, u'name': u'vanilla'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg', u'id': 19335, u'name': u'sugar'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg', u'id': 14412, u'name': u'water'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg', u'id': 1123, u'name': u'egg'}]}, {u'equipment': [], u'step': u'Mix until just combined.', u'number': 7, u'ingredients': []}, {u'equipment': [{u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg', u'id': 404665, u'name': u'stand mixer'}, {u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg', u'id': 404783, u'name': u'bowl'}], u'step': u'Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix briefly by hand to make sure there are no clumps of butter.
