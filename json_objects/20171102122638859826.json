Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. One wine you could try is Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 75 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439351,"title":"Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"#4 Wine Spectator Top 100 of 2005The Puente Alto Vineyard in the Maipo Valley has the perfect combination of climate and soils for producing world-class wine: the climate is ideal and predictable, and the soil is poor and gravelly to reduce yields and increase concentration naturally. After fermentation, the wine is matured in the finest French oak barriques for a year, followed by another year in the bottle before release. The result is a rich, full-bodied wine with an unmistakable minty character in the bouquet and the finish. Drink with the finest roasts, and strong cheeses.","price":"$75.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439351-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/don-melchor-cabernet-sauvignon-2001/79976"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 Degrees FahrenheitIf you have a meat grinder, use it to grind your bacon and beef together, if not mince your bacon as fine as possible and combine in a mixing bowl with your beefAdd all remaining ingredients to the bowl, and using your hands mix well to ensure an even distribution of ingredientsYou can now form it into a loaf and put it in a pyrex dish, put it in a loaf pan, or form into meatballs and put in the panBake for an hour or until the meat is cooked through, internal temperature needs to be at least 165 Degrees F because of the baconRemove from oven and let sit for 10-15 minutes before slicing and servingServe drizzled with some Beasty BBQ SauceEnjoy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 Degrees Fahrenheit","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"If you have a meat grinder, use it to grind your bacon and beef together, if not mince your bacon as fine as possible and combine in a mixing bowl with your beef","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"},{"id":23572,"name":"beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404700,"name":"meat grinder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/meat-grinder.jpg"},{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add all remaining ingredients to the bowl, and using your hands mix well to ensure an even distribution of ingredients","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"You can now form it into a loaf and put it in a pyrex dish, put it in a loaf pan, or form into meatballs and put in the pan","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404715,"name":"loaf pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/loaf-pan.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Bake for an hour or until the meat is cooked through, internal temperature needs to be at least 165 Degrees F because of the bacon","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Remove from oven and let sit for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Serve drizzled with some Beasty BBQ Sauce","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"Enjoy","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
