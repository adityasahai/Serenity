Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Mazzei Chianti Classico Riserva Ser Lapo. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452096,"title":"Mazzei Chianti Classico Riserva Ser Lapo","description":"Ruby red with violet nuances, this wine has bright aromas of fresh cherries mingle with notes of thyme and subtle smoky nuances.
