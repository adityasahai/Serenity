A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is Krohn Lágrima Fine Port. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430325,"title":"Krohn Lágrima Fine Port","description":"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine.
