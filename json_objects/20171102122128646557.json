You could use turkey or even just a sprinkle of bacon bits and a spitz of non-stick cooking spray to cut down the fat/points a little. All work to get the bacon flavor in there. I just happen to have a house full of bacon obsessed boys and for that reason, bacon at my disposal. Not that I mind or anything. ;)Add the cubed squash and cook it until it caramelizes a bit.Those brown spots add flavor!After a few minutes add 1/4 cup of water and quickly add the a lid to the pan.This will soften the butternut up real fast.After a minute or 2 check the squash. Repeat the process if it’s not soft enough. My pieces were small enough to only need one round of water.Add the spinach to the skillet.Don’t worry, it cooks down in no time. Just keep tossing.Pile all the ingredients towards the center of the pan and top with a raw egg.Option: Remove the hash, fry the egg and top it on the plate.Cover and cook for 2-3 minutes on medium until the egg white is cooked though.Slide everything on a plate……and enjoy!Just a tip….Make something like this on the weekend when you have a bit more time and prep the rest of the squash to use all week! I cut fry pieces and cubes to use for quick meals throughout the week. I even roasted the seeds for snacks, and since I had the cutting board out, I cubed up a melon I had on the counter. :)Take the time when you have so when you don’t, everything just a little bit easier. :)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut up the bacon into pieces and cook it down in a non-stick skillet.I used a slice of real bacon.
