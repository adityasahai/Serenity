A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Set aside.  Put remaining milk in a 4 quart sauce pan and sprinkle gelatin on top of milk.  Let gelatin sit for several minutes until it softens.  Heat milk and gelatin over medium heat, stiffing often, until milk is at the scalding point but not boiling and gelatin has dissolved. Once milk reaches the scalding point, turn heat down to low immediately and remove milk from heat.In a medium heat proof bowl, beat eggs on medium until light and frothy.  Add agave and continue beating until incorporated and lighter.  Add cream, vanilla, and stevia.  Beat until light.Add half of hot milk mixture to egg mixture, stirring constantly. Pour back into sauce pan and return to heat. Add arrowroot and stir. Cook for 5 to 10  minutes over low heat, stirring constantly. Do not boil. To see if the mix is finished cooking, dip a spoon into the mix and quickly remove it. Using a clean finger, draw a line in the mix on the back of the spoon. If the mix holds the line and does not run then it’s finished. Alternatively, use an instant read thermometer to check the temperature – it’s done cooking when it reaches 165 degrees F.Strain with a fine into a medium bowl or a quart mason jar. (You may need to use more than one jar.)  If using a bowl, cover, putting plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  With a mason jar, you screw the lid on tightly.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. The ice cream mix will thicken considerably.Stir freeze according to manufactures directions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix one tablespoon of milk with arrowroot powder.
