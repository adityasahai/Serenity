The clean, vibrant palate enters with juicy pomelo, sweet lychee and honeyedtangerine fruits, balanced by vibrant acidity and hints of yellow apple and key lime pie that last through the crisp and refreshing finish.With its balanced acidity, this versatile wine pairs well with a number of dishes, from light salads to seafood to, most notably, foods with a hint of spiciness - its subtle sweetness provides balance alongside a touch of heat. Try Chenin Blanc + Viognier with a flavorful Thai curry, a sushi dish, such asa spicy tuna roll, or seared halibut.
