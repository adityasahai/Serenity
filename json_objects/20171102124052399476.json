Place the rice in a blender and blend on high speed until it resembles coarse cornmeal, 15 to 20 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Spread coconut flakes in a baking dish and transfer to oven. Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown around the edges, 1 to 3 minutes. Place toasted coconut flakes in the bowl with the pulverized rice and cover with 3 cups water. Refrigerate overnight.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            The next day, transfer mixture to a blender and blend on high speed until only very fine pieces of rice are visible, about 2 minutes. Strain into a large bowl through a fine mesh strainer lined with a double-layer of cheesecloth. Add 1/3 cup sugar and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Adjust flavor with extra water or milk, as desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            To serve: Fill a glass with ice. Pour in the horchata. Garnish with ground cinnamon and a whole cinnamon stick if desired. Unserved horchata can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"For the Horchata: Preheat the oven to 350°F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place the rice in a blender and blend on high speed until it resembles coarse cornmeal, 15 to 20 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":20444,"name":"rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rice-white-uncooked.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"2","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Spread coconut flakes in a baking dish and transfer to oven.","ingredients":[{"id":12108,"name":"coconut flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-flakes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown around the edges, 1 to 3 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Place toasted coconut flakes in the bowl with the pulverized rice and cover with 3 cups water.
