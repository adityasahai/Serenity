turn down to medium low and simmer for about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.</li><li>Dissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar. Stir together, then let sit 10 minutes.</li><li>Add the Coach Oats mixture to yeast mixture and add the butter, salt, molasses, honey, wheat germ and milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and with the paddle attachment, mix together to combine.</li><li>Add the one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of the all purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.</li><li>With the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.</li><li>After two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so. If it is still sticking to the sides, add about 1/4 cup more flour, let it mix. Keep adding a little flour at a time until the ball of dough no longer sticks to the sides. Let it knead for 8-10 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the bowl from the mixer.</li><li>Take the dough out of the bowl and spray it with cooking spray. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry place for an hour until doubled in size (mine took almost 2 hours).</li><li>Punch down the dough and make 2.50 ounce sized balls of doughyoull get about 19 rolls.

Let them rise for about 45 minutes.</li><li>During the last 20 minutes of rise time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li><li>Fill a dutch oven or oven safe pot with water and place on the lowest shelf of the oven, this will add steam in the oven.</li><li>Brush each roll with egg wash. Bake the rolls for 17-23 minutes (you may have to do this in two batches, unless you have a huge oven). Let the rolls sit on the baking sheet sit for a few minutes, then remove rolls from pan and place on a wire rack to  cool completely.</li><li>NOTE:  Due to the molasses, the rolls will have a brown tone, so when your baking them, make sure the bottom has a light brown color to them, at first I thought I was over cooking the rolls, and I wasnt, 19 minutes seemed to be perfect amount of time.</li><li>Serving Size: 19  2.5 oz rolls</li><li>Calories per roll:  145,  Fat:  1.2,  Cholesterol:  .03,  Sodium:  20,  Potassium:  117,  Carbs:  29,  Fiber:  3,  Sugar:  3.8,  Protein:  4.9</li></ol>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, bring the 1 cup water and the Coaches Oats to a boil, turn down to medium low and simmer for about 6 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.Dissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar.
