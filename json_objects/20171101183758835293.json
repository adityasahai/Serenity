White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Heat a double burner grill pan, griddle pan, or outdoor grill over medium-high heat.                          Pour about 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil into a shallow dish and add the garlic.                          Strip the leaves off a sprig of rosemary and finely chop, about 1 tablespoon. Add the chopped rosemary to the bowl with the garlic and oil. Break the remaining rosemary up into 8 small sprigs about the size of the chicken pieces.                          Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, to taste, and add them to the garlic mixture. Turn to coat. Wrap the chicken pieces in prosciutto, securing the ham with a sprig of rosemary as you wrap. The sprigs should stick out a bit at the edges of the ham. Drizzle the chicken with more oil and grill for 12 minutes, turning occasionally.                          Serve 2 pieces of chicken for each serving, along with some lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a double burner grill pan, griddle pan, or outdoor grill over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404648,"name":"grill pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill-pan.jpg"},{"id":404779,"name":"griddle","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/griddle.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour about 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil into a shallow dish and add the garlic.","ingredients":[{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Strip the leaves off a sprig of rosemary and finely chop, about 1 tablespoon.","ingredients":[{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the chopped rosemary to the bowl with the garlic and oil.
