Heat the milk to 120 to 130°F, stirring the milk until the butter melts. Do not allow the milk to go above 130°F.In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast, salt, eggs and sugar. Add the warmed milk and butter mixture. Add 2 cups of the flour to the mixing bowl. Attach a dough hook to the mixer and combine until smooth on medium speed, for about 2 minutes. Scrape side of the bowl with a spatula as needed to incorporate the flour.Slowly add the remaining 2 cups of flour to the mixing bowl, kneading the dough on medium low speed, scraping the sides as needed. Knead until smooth until the dough is stiff and no longer sticky, about 10-12 minutes. Turn dough onto a lightly floured board, and knead for about 2-4 minutes, adding a little more flour as kneaded to prevent sticking. Shape dough into a ball and place into a lightly greased bowl (vegetable cooking spray or oil). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise for an hour in a warm place until the dough doubles in size.Punch the dough down, then divide into 3 pieces. Roll each piece to form a 1 to 1-1/2 inch rope, about 14 inches long. Create the bread on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper, the same tray you will use for baking. To create the braid: Pinch to ends of the 3 ropes together so they stick, then separate the 3 ropes so they are parallel to each other. Start with the rope furthest on the left, cross it over the center rope. Then take the rope farthest on the right, crossing it over the new center rope. Continue with this pattern until the braid reaches the bottom of the dough. Pinch the ends of the braided dough ropes together. Tuck the pinched ends of the braided dough under the dough on each side to create rounded ends. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 1 hour, until it doubles in size.Brush each braided bread with the beaten egg wash. Top with sesame or poppy seeds as desired. Bake the bread at 350°F until golden brown, approximately 17-20 minutes. Quickly transfer the baked bread to a cooling rack.
