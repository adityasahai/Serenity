Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Place the beef in a medium bowl and sprinkle it with the salt and pepper. Pour the Worcestershire sauce over it, toss to coat, and cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. You can do this ahead of time.Prepare the pasta according to package instructions. Drain, place it back in the pot, and set aside.Preheat the oven to 375 and lightly grease a 9\" pie plate or medium casserole dish.In a small skillet heat the ½ tablespoon butter and 2 teaspoons oil. Add the onion and sprinkle with the pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the onions are soft and a pretty caramel color. When the onions are cooked add them to the pasta and place the skillet back on the heat.While the onions cook, in a medium saucepan, stir together the cold milk and cornstarch. Bring it to a simmer, remove it from the heat, stir in the butter and let it melt, and then stir in the cheese. Pour the cheese over the pasta and onions and stir to combine.Add the steak to the skillet you cooked the onions in. It should be hot enough to quickly brown/ sear the beef on all sides. Brown the meat (about 4 minutes) and then add it to the pasta, onions, and cheese.Stir everything to combine it, scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish, and top with the additional ½ cup cheese.Mix the breadcrumbs with the oil and then sprinkle over the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes. The cheese on top will bubble and the breadcrumbs will be toasty and golden brown.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the beef in a medium bowl and sprinkle it with the salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the Worcestershire sauce over it, toss to coat, and cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
