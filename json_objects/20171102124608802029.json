Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

In a large bowl with electric mixer, cream butter, peanut butter, sugars and eggs.2.   In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix in to wet mixture and blend together until combined.3.   Divide dough into 2 parts. Pat into balls, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until more firm (about an hour should be perfect).4.   Roll out 1 ball of dough into a large rectangle (about 11x15-inches... not too thin) on a thin floured towel. (Dough will be soft-ish, so roll gently).5.   In a medium bowl, melt chocolate chips with sweetened condensed milk and shortening in the microwave. Set for a minute, stir, then 30 seconds more, stir... continue until melted and smooth.6.   Spoon dollops of the chocolate mixture onto the rolled out dough (using about half of the chocolate), then spread carefully to cover most of the rectangle.7.   Using the towel as a guide, carefully lift the towel to help roll the rectangle into a log. Wrap the \"log\" in the paper towel and place into the freezer for about 20 minutes, or until the log has had a chance to firm up slightly. It's okay to leave it in the freezer longer than 20 minutes. It's easier to cut when firm.8.   While first batch is in the freezer, roll out the second ball of dough. If chocolate mixture has firmed up a bit, just stick it back in the microwave to melt again. Stir until smooth and spread remaining chocolate on the rolled out dough. Roll up into a log and freeze until ready to bake.9.   When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper (or grease cookie sheets).10.   Remove firmed up cookie log from the freezer and cut into 1/4-inch slices.11.   Bake on prepared cookie sheets 13 to 15 minutes, or until cookies no longer look or feel gooey.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl with electric mixer, cream butter, peanut butter, sugars and eggs.2.
