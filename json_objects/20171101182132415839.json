Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Cut off the white end of the green onions and save for another recipe. Slice the green part thinly on a diagonal.In a medium bowl, add the flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk to combine. Whisk in the ice water until the batter is similar to traditional pancake batter. (Not too thick and not too thin). Stir in the scallions and crab.Add a thin layer of cooking oil to the bottom of a large (12-inch) non-stick saute pan. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it is hot and shimmery. Ladle the batter to the pan for the pancakes (about 3 or so 4-inch pancakes per batch). Cook for about 3 or 4 minutes until the edges look dried and bottom has browned. Flip pancakes and cook for another 3 or 4 minutes or until browned. Add more cooking oil as needed.Transfer the cooked pancakes to a cutting board. Repeat cooking with the remaining batter.Cut the pancakes into bite-sized pieces. Serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.Place all ingredients except toasted sesame seeds in a jar with a lid.
