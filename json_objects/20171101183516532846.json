Though gazpacho is said to be a tricky pairing, all these Spanish wines can work. One wine you could try is Salneval Albarino. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 9 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":446012,"title":"Salneval Albarino","description":"Light straw in color, the nose of this Albari√±o is seductive with honey, pear and tropical fruit and a slight mineral component. It is racy andzesty with citrus and floral flavors in the mouth, yet is round and soft at the same time.It matches perfectly with fresh seafood and shellfish; is an ideal accompaniment to salty, spicy Asian cuisine; and is also great on its own as a cocktail wine. Truly adventurous food lovers will amaze and inspire their friends by serving it with the unlikely, but fantastic pairing of traditional barbequed ribs with a sweet, slightly spicy tomato based sauce.","price":"$9.39","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446012-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/salneval-albarino-2008/98474"}]},"instructions":"1.
