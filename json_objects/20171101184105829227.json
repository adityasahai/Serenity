Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Grease a mini cheesecake pan and line the bottom of 16 cheesecake slots with an oreo. Set aside. Roughly chop the remaining 10 oreos, set aside. In a stand mixer, beat PHILADELPHIA cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add egg and vanilla extract, beating until well combined. Fold in chopped oreos by hand, until just combined. The more you stir, the more the red from the candy cane oreos will color the cheesecake. Fill each cheesecake slot until 3/4 of the way full. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until no longer giggly in the center. Cool for at least 30 minutes on a wire rack and then transfer to the fridge to cool for at least 3 hours. You want the cheesecake to be cold.When ready to serve: In bowl of a stand mixer, combine the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar. Using whisk attachment, mix on high for 1-2 minutes, or until soft peaks have formed.Add vanilla extract and beat for about a minute longer, or until stiff peaks have formed. Carefully remove cheesecakes from pan, removing pan bottoms. Transfer whipped cream to a piping bag and pipe onto cooled cheesecakes. Sprinkle with crushed candy canes and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.
