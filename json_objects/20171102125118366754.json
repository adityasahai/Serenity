A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Sandeman Vintage Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 135 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430502,"title":"Sandeman Vintage Port","description":null,"price":"$135.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430502-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/1970-Sandeman-Vintage-Port-750/dp/B00FH1O8KK"}]},"instructions":"Lay your 3 slices of bacon on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet and place in the cold ovenTurn your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit and start the cooking processLet your bacon cook until it is crispy and you can cut into your own home made bacon bits, mine took about 35 minutesOnce your bacon is done, place your coconut milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a blender and mix wellTake your frozen ice cream maker bowl out and place on your cuisinart ice cream maker and start it, pour your ingredients through the top and let the magic happenChop your bacon into tiny bacon bit size piecesAbout 5 minutes in when your ice cream starts to solidify, add all your bacon bits and let the magic keep happening.Once your ice cream is done, transfer to another bowl and let it set in the freezer to your likingEnjoy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Lay your 3 slices of bacon on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet and place in the cold oven","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Turn your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit and start the cooking process","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Let your bacon cook until it is crispy and you can cut into your own home made bacon bits, mine took about 35 minutes","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Once your bacon is done, place your coconut milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a blender and mix well","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla extract","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg"},{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Take your frozen ice cream maker bowl out and place on your cuisinart ice cream maker and start it, pour your ingredients through the top and let the magic happen","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404791,"name":"ice cream machine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ice-cream-machine.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Chop your bacon into tiny bacon bit size pieces","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"About 5 minutes in when your ice cream starts to solidify, add all your bacon bits and let the magic keep happening.Once your ice cream is done, transfer to another bowl and let it set in the freezer to your liking","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Enjoy","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
