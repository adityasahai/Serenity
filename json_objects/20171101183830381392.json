Add half of egg, reserving other half for later, and mix, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.In a medium bowl, combine all flours. With the mixer on low speed, add flours all at once; mix until well combined.Turn dough out onto work surface and form into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours.Once dough is ready, preheat oven to 350°.Place dough on a floured work surface and roll out to 1/8-inch thick. (Here’s the tricky part. The dough needs to be warm enough to manipulate but cold enough to hold it’s shape. Frequent, but quick trips, to the freezer are necessary.) Cut out 10 even rectangles, about 3\"x4\" each.Place 5 tart rectangles on a baking sheet. Fill with jam, about 1 heaping tablespoon per tart, leaving half an inch clearing space around the outer edge of the rectangle. Carefully place tart rectangle on top and press with a fork around the edges to seal. Trim away any extraneous dough. Repeat. If dough begins to crack, dip finger in water and smooth. Works like magic. Brush tarts with egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado.Transfer to a freezer for 10 minutes. (This helps the dough to hold its shape.)Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool before serving. Reserve leftovers in an air tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar until well combined.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add half of egg, reserving other half for later, and mix, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.In a medium bowl, combine all flours.
