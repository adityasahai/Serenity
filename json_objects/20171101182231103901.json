A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar and beat until thick and lemon-colored. Blend in orange juice and peel. Sift together flour and salt; add to batter. Beat until smooth. In another bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. While beating, add the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoons at a time. Beat until stiff. Fold 1/4 of the egg whites into the batter; then fold in remaining whites. Spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan, smoothing top.
