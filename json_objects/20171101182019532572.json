Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and fold in until just a few streaks of the dry remain. Add the dates and continue to fold just until everything is evenly combined and dates are dispersed. Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth top with a spatula if needed. Arrange banana slices on top in three rows, and sprinkle with chopped pecans. Generously sprinkle entire top with coarse sugar. Bake bread at 375F for 5 minutes, and then reduce heat to 350F and bake another 75-80 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.
