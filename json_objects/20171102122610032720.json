Add Meyer lemon zest, Meyer lemon juice and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated. The mixture may seem to separate briefly, but simply keep mixing until it comes together and becomes creamy. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch and salt. With the mixer on low, gently add dry ingredients, about 1/4 cup at a time, beating briefly between each addition, until all of the flour mixture is incorporated. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a 1 1/2 inch diameter log. Wrap each half in parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for about 1 hour or until firm. You can alternatively freeze the rolls for about 30 minutes. Remove dough from fridge, unwrap and slice into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place on parchment lined baking sheets and bake for about 13-14 minutes or until cookies are just turning golden, but still a bit soft to the touch. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for about 10 minutes. Place remaining confectioner’s sugar in a gallon size zip top bag. Add about 3-4 cookies at a time to the bag, seal the bag and toss gently to coat the cookies in the sugar. Remove cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store cookies in an air tight container for up to 1 week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.Cream together butter and 1/3 cup of confectioner’s sugar, in the bowl of a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment, on medium speed until light and fluffy.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add Meyer lemon zest, Meyer lemon juice and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated.
