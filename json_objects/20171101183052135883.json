Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

The mixture will be very thick and sticky.With a medium cookie scoop place balls in the cookie sheet and lightly formed them like a more perfect ball about1 1/2\" in size.  Flatten them slightly with your hands if you like.Bake for about 15-20 minutes.

I baked mine for 10 minutes so I think you will probably have to bake them for a couple of minutes longer.
