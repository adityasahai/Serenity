Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Set aside.Halve the spaghetti squash and remove the seeds. Lightly drizzle and rub the insides and outsides of the squash with olive oil, sprinkle the insides of each half with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, then place cut sides down on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the squash until fork tender, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 10-15 minutes, until cool enough to handle, then shred in insides into strands with a fork. Set aside.Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high. Add the mushrooms and saut until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper, then saut until fragrant, about 1 additional minute. Add the chopped spinach by handfuls, allowing it to wilt, then adding more as it will fit into your skillet. Cook just until all of the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes.Add the shredded squash to the skillet, then cook just until heated through, about 2 minutes. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as desired. Stir in the Parmesan and parsley. Serve warm, topped with additional parsley and Parmesan as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.
