If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam. Uncorked at the very last minute, Bellissima Sparkling Rosé pairs perfectly with smoked salmon, shellfish, and seafood hor d’oeuvres such as tuna tartare, sushi, and sashimi.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/458665-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bellissima-sparkling-rose/293794"}]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 425 degrees.Dump the rinsed chickpeas onto a paper towel and dry them off well. Remove any of the papery skins that fall of the chickpeas, and then place them into a medium bowl.Drizzle the olive oil, cumin and smoked paprika onto the chickpeas and toss to evenly coat. Spread them onto a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Bake the chickpeas for 15 minutes, stir, and then bake another 15 minutes until they are golden brown and crunchy. Let cool for a few minutes.Once cooled, put the chickpeas into a SMALL food processor (mine is 3 cups) and process until crumbly.In a large bowl, mix together the hummus, grated cheddar cheese and cilantro. Whisk the egg in a small bowl, and then add it into the hummus mixture. Finally, add in the chickpea crumbles. Stir until evenly mixed. Your mixture will be quite wet.Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and drop 16 heaping Tablespoon-sized balls of the hummus mixture onto the prepared pan. You should have a little bit left over to help seal the bites after you put the cheese in.Press one of the cheese cubes into the center of a ball and use your fingers to press the hummus batter around it, and close off the hole. Additionally, form the balls into a circle with a small spoon. Repeat for all the bites. It will be messy. I found it helps to wash your hands every few bites. If any bites have some visible cheese, use the remaining mixture to press on top.Spray the bites with cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes. Then, spray them again and bake an additional 6-8 minutes until golden brown and crispy.Serve IMMEDIATELY with the guacamole to dip.DEVOUR!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 425 degrees.Dump the rinsed chickpeas onto a paper towel and dry them off well.","ingredients":[{"id":16057,"name":"chickpeas","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/paper-towels.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove any of the papery skins that fall of the chickpeas, and then place them into a medium bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":16057,"name":"chickpeas","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Drizzle the olive oil, cumin and smoked paprika onto the chickpeas and toss to evenly coat.","ingredients":[{"id":1012028,"name":"smoked paprika","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg"},{"id":16057,"name":"chickpeas","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Spread them onto a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Bake the chickpeas for 15 minutes, stir, and then bake another 15 minutes until they are golden brown and crunchy.","ingredients":[{"id":16057,"name":"chickpeas","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Let cool for a few minutes.Once cooled, put the chickpeas into a SMALL food processor (mine is 3 cups) and process until crumbly.In a large bowl, mix together the hummus, grated cheddar cheese and cilantro.","ingredients":[{"id":1001009,"name":"shredded cheddar cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shredded-cheese-cheddar.png"},{"id":16057,"name":"chickpeas","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chickpeas.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Whisk the egg in a small bowl, and then add it into the hummus mixture.
