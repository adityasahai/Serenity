In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus.

Whisk to mix well.Add the liquids to the dry ingredients and mix until all the flour is just moistened. The batter will still look lumpy.
