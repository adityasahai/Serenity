Using your fingers or a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour. Continue until the mixture resembles even-sized crumbs. Next, start by adding 1 ½ cups of the cream. Stir until the mixture is just combined. If the dough is too dry, add additional cream, 1 tablespoon at a time (I used 1 ¾ cups cream).Pat the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough to ¾ inch in thickness. Using a biscuit cutter, cut the dough into rounds and place on the prepared baking sheet. Re-form and roll out the dough as needed until all the dough is used.Brush the tops of the biscuits with additional cream. Bake for 25 to 28 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
