Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Silverado Mt. George Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436498,"title":"Silverado Mt. George Merlot","description":"Mt.
