White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is District 7 Estate Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"1) Blend cream cheese & 3 tablespoons butter. Add chicken and next five ingredients--fold together until blended.2) Unroll crescent roll dough and divide into rectangles (4 per can) pressing together the diagonal perforations.3) Place rounded 1/2 cup chicken mixture in center of each dough rectangle. Fold dough over filling and pressing edges together to seal.4) Dip turnovers in remaining melted butter and then roll in bread crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.These can be assembled ahead of time and then placed in the oven 30 minutes before serving. If you find it difficult for the perforations to \"hold together\" you may want to try using a rolling pin to gently roll the perforations together. ","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Blend cream cheese & 3 tablespoons butter.","ingredients":[{"id":1017,"name":"cream cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cream-cheese.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add chicken and next five ingredients--fold together until blended.2) Unroll crescent roll dough and divide into rectangles (4 per can) pressing together the diagonal perforations.3)","ingredients":[{"id":93618,"name":"crescent roll dough","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crescent-rolls.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place rounded 1/2 cup chicken mixture in center of each dough rectangle.
