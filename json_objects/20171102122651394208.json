These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. One wine you could try is Bohigas Brut Reserva Cava. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":440298,"title":"Bohigas Brut Reserva Cava","description":"Pale yellow colour. Constant and small bubble. Foam of great persistence. Very fruity aromas, especially of white fruit (acid apple and pear) on shades of peel of citrics and white flowers. In the background, some spicy notes owed to ageing (cinnamon) and cookies. It is a well-structured \"cava\" in the mouth. Well picked up over its acidity that tenses it overall from beginning to end. The bubble lends a creamy feeling, and it gives volume and softness to the structure that returns acidity and widens the aromas of white fruits and spices that are repeated in the mouth. Its balanced end harmonizes its acidity, and leaves a memory of freshness and volume owing to its light sugar content","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440298-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bohigas-brut-reserva-cava/131248"}]},"instructions":"1. Pour the tequila, agave nectar, lime juice, and orange liqueur over ice in a large pitcher and stir vigorously.2. To salt the rims of the 8 margarita glasses, pour enough salt into a saucer so that it’s about 1/4-inch deep. Cut a little notch in the flesh of a lime wedge and run it along the rim of the glass until the edge is uniformly moistened, making a nice clean line on the outside of the glass. Hold the glass by the bottom and gently tip the outer edge into the salt, rolling to coat evenly. Tap or shake gently to remove any loose grains. Repeat with the remaining lime wedges and glasses.3. Fill each salt-rimmed glass with fresh ice, pour in the margarita mixture, garnish with a jalapeño slice (or, if you’re brave, an entire jalapeño) and a lime wedge, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour the tequila, agave nectar, lime juice, and orange liqueur over ice in a large pitcher and stir vigorously.2.
