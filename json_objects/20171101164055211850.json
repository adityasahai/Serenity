Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C).2. Rub the garlic cloves with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Wrap them in foil and roast for about 35 minutes, until softened. Let cool, then peel the garlic cloves and slice them.3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Core the tomatoes and cut an X in the bottom of each. Add 3 of the tomatoes at a time to the boiling water and blanch for about 15 seconds, until the skin at the X starts to loosen. Remove with tongs or a wire skimmer and immediately plunge into the ice water to cool briefly; drain. Peel the tomatoes and cut them into quarters. Put 12 red tomato quarters and 12 yellow tomato quarters in a small bowl for the salad. Add half the sliced garlic, cover, and refrigerate. Slice the pulp and seeds from the remaining tomato quarters, leaving only the flesh. Put 1/4 cup of the seeds and pulp for the salad dressing in a separate small bowl; cover and refrigerate. Discard the remaining pulp. Transfer the tomato flesh to another bowl and add the remaining sliced garlic; set aside for the terrine.4. Put the milk in a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and let stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin. Bring the milk to a simmer over low heat, whisking until the gelatin has dissolved. Transfer to a medium bowl add the goat cheese, and whisk until well blended.5. Line an 8 1/2 X 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 4-inch overhang on each long side. Lay 2 or 3 arugula leaves lengthwise down the center of the bottom of the pan. Add half the remaining arugula and half the basil to the tomatoes, tossing to mix. Spread one quarter of the goat-cheese mixture in the bottom of the loaf pan. Cover with one third of the tomato mixture. Spread with another layer of goat cheese and top with half the remaining tomatoes. Repeat one more time and finish with a layer of goat cheese. Fold the plastic wrap over the top to cover the terrine. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or up to 12 hours.6. Just before serving, in a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons oil with the lime juice, balsamic vinegar, and the refrigerated tomato pulp. Add the refrigerated tomatoes and garlic. Stir gently to coat. Coarsely chop the remaining arugula and basil and add to the salad, stirring gently to mix.7. To serve, peel back the plastic wrap from the top of the terrine, invert it onto a cutting board, and remove the plastic wrap. Cut into eight 1-inch slices. Serve the salad alongside the terrine.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C).2. Rub the garlic cloves with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.
