The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. One wine you could try is Eroica Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":434655,"title":"Eroica Riesling","description":"This Eroica shows the crisp acidity of the 2007 vintage, which was the best acidity holding year in the past five years. The wine delivers mandarin orange and sweet lime aromas and flavors with subtle mineral notes. The cooler September, along with selecting fruit from higher elevation and cooler sites, contributed to the mouth-watering acidity balanced by beautiful Washington Riesling fruit.An amazing pairing with sweet, flavorful Dungeness crab.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434655-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/eroica-riesling-2007/96190"}]},"instructions":"Stir together all ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.Add a few inches of water to a wide, shallow saucepan and bring to a full boil. Add the asparagus spears and cook until bright green but still crunchy on the inside, about 2 minutes. Drain the water and place the asparagus on a plate. Refrigerate until completely cool. Once cool, cut the asparagus spears in half.Fill the saucepan with water and bring it to a full boil, then add the vermicelli noodles. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until the noodles are soft. Drain the water and keep the noodles in a colander.Fill the saucepan with 1 to 2 inches of water and bring to almost a boil. Remove from heat. Carefully and quickly lay one spring roll wrapper on top of the water, just until the full surface of the wrapper touches the surface of the water and it becomes pliable. Remove the wrapper from the water and place it on a smooth cutting board or a piece of parchment paper.Place two pieces of asparagus in the center of the wrapper, followed by the vermicelli noodles, two thick pieces of avocado, and one basil or mint leaf. Roll up one lettuce leaf and place it on top of the avocado. Wrap the spring roll tightly. Repeat for remaining ingredients. Serve immediately with Citrus Dipping Sauce or wrap rolls individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Stir together all ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add a few inches of water to a wide, shallow saucepan and bring to a full boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the asparagus spears and cook until bright green but still crunchy on the inside, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11011,"name":"asparagus","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asparagus.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Drain the water and place the asparagus on a plate.
