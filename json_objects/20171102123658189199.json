Set aside to cool for just a few minutes, then transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in eggs and vanilla extract until smooth.Next add in the dry ingredients: almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt; stirring until smooth.

Push the raspberries into the top of the brownie batter.If you are baking them in the skillets, bake for 12-15 minutes until the edges start to pull away from the pan. If you are baking the brownies in the loaf pan, bake for 18-23 minutes until edges are set. It's always better to underbake your brownies so they remain fudgy. After baking, transfer to a wire rack to cool before cutting and serving.To make the chocolate drizzle: Place a small saucepan over low heat and add chocolate chips and coconut oil, stirring until completely smooth.
