Boil the unpeeled new potatoes in salted water until fork tender, not soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, cool, and then cut into bite-size chunks.2. Slice the onion, red pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, and chard into similar thicknesses for even cooking.3. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the potatoes and a little salt and pepper and saute until browned, about 10 minutes, shaking the pan on occasion. Add the onion, pepper, and mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until soft. Add the zucchini and chard and cook for 5 minutes longer, until all vegetables are nicely browned along with the potatoes. Season with a little more salt and pepper.4. Poach the eggs just before new potato hash is done. Have a medium pot of water simmering at a rapid speed. One at a time, crack the eggs into a small bowl, then gently slip them into the simmering water. Poach the eggs 2 minutes for soft yolks or longer if you like them harder. One at a time, scoop out the poached eggs with a slotted spoon and gently rest on a towel for just a second to soak up any water.5. To serve, divide the hash among bowls; top each serving with a poached egg, salsa, and sour cream. Sprinkle with the parsley or cilantro to finish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil the unpeeled new potatoes in salted water until fork tender, not soft, 20 to 25 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11352,"name":"new potato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-potatoes.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain, cool, and then cut into bite-size chunks.2.
