Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook pasta according to package directions.Meanwhile, mix the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper in a large bowl.  Drain the pasta and add to the bowl with the balsamic vinaigrette.  Stir well to coat the pasta.  Add the leftover grilled vegetables on top and sprinkle with goat cheese.Cassie’s Notes:This pasta salad can be served hot or cold.  Leave out the cheese for a vegan adaptation. When grilling the vegetables, we used Star Fine Foods garlic-infused olive oil, dried thyme, dried sage, salt and pepper and grilled them in a grilling basket for 15-20 minutes, tossing the veggies often.  They get a nice char and grilled flavor and cook very evenly.  Store the grilled vegetable leftovers in the refrigerator in an airtight container until making this pasta salad.  Alternately, you can roast the vegetables in a large baking dish at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes until tender, tossing often.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook pasta according to package directions.Meanwhile, mix the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain the pasta and add to the bowl with the balsamic vinaigrette.
