Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry.

Place all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Pour into a buttered loaf pan (I always use a glass loaf pan to ensure even baking).
