Beer might seem like the natural pick for German food, but German riesling pairs wonderfully with seafood and schnitzel, while a German red like Dornfelder goes well with beef and game meat. The Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"Boil egg in water until they are hard boiled. Set aside and let them cool. Clean them up and cut in half. Cut the bone out of chicken thighs. Tenderize from inside, leaving skin on the outside, where the chicken is very thin. Mix ground beef, pork and turkey, together with garlic salt and pepper. Take chicken, lay it flat on a working area, sprinkle a little seasoning. Cover the chicken with a layer of ground meat, place 2 halfs of an egg next to each other. Roll up both sides of the chicken, making it into a tight roll. Repeat until you use up all of your ingredients.Place rolls on baking pan. Side with loose ends facing down. Sprinkle with Vegeta. Bake at 325F for 45 minutes. Once they are cooked, drain all fats from the pan, set them aside until they are completely cooled down; I do it overnight. Slice them into pieces.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil egg in water until they are hard boiled. Set aside and let them cool.
