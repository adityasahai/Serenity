A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Set aside.Place all the cake ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix together, starting on low speed. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, turn speed up to medium high and beat until smooth and well combined.Divide batter evenly between the two cake pans and smooth with a spatula. Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until golden and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for about 2 minutes then run a knife around the outside and invert cakes on a cooling rack to cool completely.Place chocolate in a large heat proof bowl. Heat cream on the stove top over medium low heat until bubbles are just beginning to form around the outside surface. Keep an eye on it because it can bubble over fast! Remove from heat and immediately pour over chopped chocolate. Allow to sit for 5 minutes then whisk until smooth.Place the heavy whipping cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (this works even better if you’ve chilled your bowl before hand). Whip the cream, starting on medium speed and increasing to high until soft peaks form. Stir in orange juice, powdered sugar, and orange zest. Continue to whisk until peaks are firm.Place one layer of cake on the serving platter. Top with cooled but still pourable ganache, enough to generously cover the top and run down the sides a bit. Place half of the fresh berries on top of the ganache followed by half of the whipped cream.Add the second layer of cake over the whipped cream, followed by more ganache, and the rest of the whipped cream. Finally, pile the remaining berries in the center. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Note: Ganache will harden when refrigerated. If you’d like it soft, serve immediately or allow to come to room temperature before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Butter 2 8 inch round cake pans and dust with coconut flour.
