A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Cook for about 20 minutes or until the squash is tender. Drain and cool completely. Transfer the squash to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Measure out 1 cup of puree and set aside. Refrigerate or freeze the remaining puree for another use (or to make more cakes later!)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). Butter or spray three 5×3-inch mini loaf pans or a 12-cup cupcake pan or a 9×2-inch round cake pan.Pour the oil and maple syrup in a mixer bowl and beat on medium for a couple minutes.Add the eggs, one at time, beating well after each. Add the yogurt and beat the mixture until smooth.Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and spices into a medium bowl.Add half of the flour mixture to the liquid mixture and mix on low until just combined.Mix in butternut squash puree. Then add the rest of the flour mixture and mix until combined.Pour into your prepared pan(s), if making mini-cakes or cupcakes fill tins about 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes for the cake or mini-cakes or 25-30 minutes for cupcakes. Cool on a wire rack.While the cakes are cooling, beat together the cream cheese, milk, maple syrup and powdered sugar. The glaze should be thick but pourable, add more milk or maple syrup to adjust the thickness or sweetness if necessary.When the cakes are still warm but not hot to the touch, remove from the pan(s) and drizzle or pour the glaze on top. Serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring a large pot of water to boil and add the chunks of butternut squash.
