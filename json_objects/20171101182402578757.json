I usually cut off about 2-3 inches of stems.2) Blanch rabe in boiled, salted water for about a minute. Drain rabe and run under cool water. Roughly chop the rabe.3) In a large pot, add oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and rosemary. Set over low to medium-low heat for 4-5 minutes until it's very fragrant.4) Remove rosemary sprigs and add vegetable broth and water. Turn up heat and bring to a boil.5) Add pasta and rabe, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes (depends on pasta cooking time... add a few minutes to time on box). Make sure the braising liquid is almost or slightly covering the pasta and rabe. If not, add more water.6) Meanwhile, lightly toast walnuts in a dry pan.7) Serve pasta and rabe with walnuts and maybe a dash of hot sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Drain rabe and run under cool water.
