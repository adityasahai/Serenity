Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add plums and toss to coat; transfer plums to a plate.Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush kale leaves with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt. Grill kale, turning once, until crispy and charred at edges, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a work surface; let stand until cool enough to handle. Remove large center stems with a knife and discard (just trim the tough ends from smaller, more tender kale stems). Alternatively, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Toss kale leaves with oil and arrange in a single layer on a foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until crispy.Divide ricotta among plates; season with salt and pepper. Stir vinaigrette again. Tear larger kale leaves into pieces (leave smaller leaves whole). Place leaves in a large bowl and toss with some of the vinaigrette. Divide leaves among plates. Top with plums and drizzle some vinaigrette over.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil together with vinegar, thyme, and honey in a medium bowl.
