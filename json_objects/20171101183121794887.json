Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tiamo Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 8 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

Add the artichoke hearts and stir for 2 minutes more.  3. Add cream, salt, pepper and tarragon and turn the heat up high enough to bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.4. Pour the seafood mixture into a broiler-safe baking dish that will hold it in one layer.  Spread the artichoke \"crust\" mixture over the top.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. 5. Pre-heat the broiler and broil the pot pie until the cheese is melted, about 3-5 minutes, watching carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.
