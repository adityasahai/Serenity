Heat oil on medium heat.Open the can of biscuits and separate each one. Flatten each biscuit slightly with your hand and cut out the centers with a small biscuit cutter.Once the oil is hot, fry donuts 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown on each side, using a wooden skewer or metal spatula to turn them over. Remove the donuts and place them on a paper towel lined baking sheet, until they are slightly cooled down.  Repeat with remaining dough.Heat heavy cream in the microwave for 30 seconds or until it simmers, but watch it to make sure it doesn't spill over. Pour hot cream over chocolate chips and stir until smooth.Dip the top half of the donut in the ganache and then set it on a cooling rack that has been placed inside a baking sheet to dry. (The baking sheet catches any drips.)Add the halved peanut butter cups after the ganache has mostly cooled down; if it's too hot still, it will melt the peanut butter cups.Heat the peanut butter in the microwave for 15 seconds or until slightly melty, but not runny.  Scoop the warm peanut butter into a zip top bag, seal it shut, then cut off the corner, and while squeezing, zig-zag the peanut butter over each donut.  Enjoy!  Store any extra donuts in a container with a lid for a day or two.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill a large stock pot or dutch oven with oil 2 to 3 inches high from the bottom.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/dutch-oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat oil on medium heat.Open the can of biscuits and separate each one.
