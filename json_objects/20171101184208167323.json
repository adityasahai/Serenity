A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry.

Remove it from the heat and stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar. Stir in the vanilla. Let it cool for a minute before adding the egg and then GENTLY stir it in (you don't want scrambled eggs).Add the wet mixture to the dry and stir until completely combined.Stir in the chocolate chips before the butter has completely cooled so they melt a little.Spoon the cookie dough about ½ tablespoon at a time onto an ungreased baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.Bake for 8 minutes. Let them cool slightly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.While the cookies cool, make the no-bake cheesecake. Beat together the cream cheese and peanut butter. Beat in the vanilla and the sweetened condensed milk.Set out 6-8 cupcake liners (not in a muffin tin). Set the cookies at a slight angle in the liners so that they form a \"bottom\" to the cheesecake but one side sits up over the paper edge.Spoon the cheesecake batter over the top of the cookie, up to the edge of the paper liner. To \"shape\" these, I double-lined the no-bake cheesecakes and carefully set them down into a muffin tin to refrigerate.Refrigerate for 2-4 hours.When the cheesecake has set, place the chocolate chips and the heavy cream into a small saucepan over medium low heat. Stir until the chocolate has melted (you may need to raise the heat gradually just a little bit). Then stir in the butter until smooth.Drizzle the chocolate over each of the cheesecakes. Sprinkle the chopped peanuts over the melted chocolate.Refrigerate just a little longer so the chocolate can set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350.In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.","ingredients":[{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove it from the heat and stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar.
