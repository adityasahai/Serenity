about 3-4 minutes. Watch carefully as it browns quickly. Set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add oats, almonds, half of the toasted coconut (reserve the rest for serving), dried fruit, coconut sugar, and salt. Stir to combine.Add maple syrup and non-dairy milk to the flax eggs and whisk thoroughly to combine. While whisking, pour in the coconut oil and whisk thoroughly to combine. (NOTE: If the mixture gets clumpy, microwave for 10-20 seconds to re-melt coconut oil. However, it will melt in the oven while baking so it's not a big concern.)Pour oatmeal into prepared dish and bake for 37-40 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and firm in the middle. Then increase heat to 400 degrees F (204 C) and bake 5-8 minutes more to brown the edges and crisp the top.Serve warm with desired toppings, such as coconut whipped cream (or coconut milk or almond milk), extra toasted coconut, and fruit.
