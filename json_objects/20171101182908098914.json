Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441958,"title":"Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The wine at first has a light ruby color. It has aromas of black cherry/cherry and violets with the characteristic Bien Nacido dried herbs and light pepper spice balanced by the toasty oak spice and vanilla influence of French oak barrel aging. There are flavors of cherry and red berry with dried herbs followed by a light pepper spice. The sweet oak spice and vanilla is nicely balanced by the fruit flavors. The wine is concentrated and elegant with a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.","price":"$33.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441958-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/sanctuary-bien-nacido-vineyard-pinot-noir-2007/109741"}]},"instructions":"Place a small skillet over medium high heat and another small skillet over medium heat.In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the hummus, water, salt, and pepper.Pour the oil into the skillet over medium heat, then add the eggs.
