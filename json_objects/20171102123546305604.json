vegetarian"],"occasions":["christmas"],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Place rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Arrange bread in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes or until lightly toasted. (Alternatively, you can let bread cubes sit out overnight.) To bake individual bread puddings: Lightly spritz a muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners. (Alternatively, you can use 6, 6-ounce lightly greased ramekins or 6 ungreased mini panettone papers.) To bake a single bread pudding: Lightly spritz a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.Meanwhile for the bourbon sauce: Place a deep mixing bowl, beaters, and the 1/3 cup evaporated milk in the freezer to chill for 20 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the 3/4 cup evaporated milk, non-fat milk, eggs, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, all spice, cloves and salt. Add bread cubes, ginger, pecans, and raisins. Let mixture stand 20 minutes, stirring the bread occasionally to ensure all cubes soak up the milk.To bake bread pudding immediately: Fill prepared pan(s) nearly to the top, gently pressing to compact. (If baking with ramekins or mini panettone papers, set the baking dishes atop a baking sheet prior to placing in the oven.) To freeze and bake: Wrap the filled pan(s) tightly with plastic wrap, then foil, and freeze for up to 3 weeks. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, then bake as directed.Bake at 350 degrees F until deep golden brown on top and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean: 20-25 minutes for muffin cups; 30-35 minutes for ramekins or mini panettones; 43-47 minutes for a single loaf pan.To prepare sauce: While the bread pudding is in the oven, beat evaporated milk in the chilled bowl on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until it is the consistency of whipped cream. Gradually add sugar, bourbon, and yogurt and beat for several minutes longer, until thickened. Serve over warm bread pudding.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
