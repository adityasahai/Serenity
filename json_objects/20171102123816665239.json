A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430034,"title":"NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port","description":"An amazing after dinner aperitif.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with butter and line the bottom and 2 sides with parchment paper.                          In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and eggs. Stir in the mashed bananas, oil, cinnamon and vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture a third at a time and mix until just combined. Fold in the sliced bananas.                          Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out mostly clean (some moist crumbs should stick to it), about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool completely.                          Meanwhile, combine the butter, brown sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and stir in the rum.                          While the bread is cooling, poke it all over with a skewer. Brush with half of the rum sauce and allow it to sit and soak through. Remove the banana bread from the loaf pan once cool, slice and serve with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of the remaining rum sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
