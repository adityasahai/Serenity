Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tiamo Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 8 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color.
