Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400F.Set a wire rack over a large rimmed baking sheet and spray the rack with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.In a small shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and Parmesan; mix to combine.In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites.Dredge each tender first in the egg whites, then in the bread crumbs, pressing to coat.Put the coated tenders on a plate as you go, repeating the process until all the tenders are coated.In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over medium-high heat.Add half the tenders and cook until golden brown on all sides; about 3 minutes per side.Transfer chicken tenders to previously prepared wire rack.Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil to the skillet, and repeat the cooking process with the remaining tenders.Transfer the remaining chicken tenders to the prepared wire rack.Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tenders are golden brown and cooked through.In the meantime, prepare the Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.
