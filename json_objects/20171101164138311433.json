Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Place a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, sauté for 3 minutes. Then add all the dried spices and stir into the onions. “Toasting” the spices opens up the flavors faster! Next add the ginger and garlic—sauté another 1-2 minutes.Add the tomato puree, 1 ½ tsp. salt, and water. Stir in the yogurt. Simmer for 20-25 minutes—while you are cooking the rice.Set a smaller pot over high heat. Add 1-2 Tb. of oil and the dried rice. Sear the rice for 1-2 minutes, stirring to coat it in oil. Add the water (usually 3 cups, but check package) and cover to bring to a boil. Once boiling, stir, add a pinch of saffron and a large pinch of salt, then cover and lower heat to simmer. Simmer for about 15 minutes, then remove from heat but keep covered until ready to serve.Once the rice is ready, remove the bay leaves. Use an immersion blender to puree the curry. This is an optional step I like to take to improve the texture!Add the shrimp to the curry pot. Stir them in and allow them to cook for 3-5 minutes—until pink. Taste for salt. Serve the Rogan Josht over the saffron rice, with some naan on the side!*Madras curry powder has some heat to it!
