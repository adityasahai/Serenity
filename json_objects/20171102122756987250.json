The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434105,"title":"Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"Intense ruby red color. Clear notes of strawberries, raspberries, spice and vanilla stand out on the nose.

Place the pizza dough on a baking sheet and brush with 1 tablespoon olive oil; set aside. Grill the sausages, turning often, until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and slice into 1/4-inch-thick rounds; set aside.                          Combine the bell peppers, parsley, red onion, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat; set aside.                          Stretch the pizza dough into a 12-inch round. Place the pizza dough directly on the grill grates; cook until the crust is golden and marked, about 5 minutes. Flip the crust and spread with the marinara sauce. Top with half of the cheese, then the sausage and the remaining cheese. Cover and grill until the cheese melts and the crust is cooked through, about 6 more minutes. Remove the pizza from the grill; let sit 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with the bell pepper salad.
