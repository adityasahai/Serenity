Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for about 15 minutes or until softened. Stir in the potatoes, garlic, and smoked paprika. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the potatoes are just starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and pour in the broth.Cover the skillet and place it in the oven. Bake covered for about 10 minutes (or until the potatoes are tender), then remove the cover and cook until the liquid has reduced into a thick sauce that coats the potatoes, about 15-20 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle with parsley, if using. Serve with Spicy Romesco Sauce.Preheat oven to 400ºF.Toss the tomato and pepper chunks with 1 tablespoon of olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 25 minutes, stirring halfway through, then stir in the almonds and roast for 5 minutes more, until the almonds are toasted. (Be careful not to leave them in the oven for longer than this—they will burn!) Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.Transfer the peppers, tomatoes, and almonds to a food processor and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, and a teaspoon of harissa. Process until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add additional harissa 1 teaspoon at a time until the sauce reaches your desired level of spiciness. (Because brands of harissa vary a great deal in spice level, it's best to be conservative! I use Mina harissa and 1 tablespoon is perfect.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375ºF.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the olive oil and butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for about 15 minutes or until softened.
