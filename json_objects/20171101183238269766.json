If you’re steaming the pudding on the hob, boil the kettle and have a large saucepan with a lid and a heatproof saucer ready. Cut a sheet of foil and greaseproof paper, both about 30cm long, and butter the greaseproof.Spoon 3 tbsp syrup into the bottom of the basin. Lay 5 slices of clementine or satsuma in the bottom, overlapping like petals. In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar until creamy, then add eggs gradually, beating all the while, until light and fluffy. Add a spoonful of flour if the mix starts to split. Tip in the breadcrumbs and the rest of the flour, fold until combined, then add all remaining ingredients and fold again. Spoon mix on top of the fruit slices. Add remaining slices of clementine or satsuma against the side of the bowl as you go.To cook on the hob, cover with greaseproof and foil and steam for 1½ hrs (see Know-how, below). To microwave, losely cover with cling film, pierce once, then cook on Medium for 12 mins. To check it’s done, poke a skewer into the pudding; it should come out clean.Make the syrup by heating the ingredientsin a small pan.
