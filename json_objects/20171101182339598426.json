Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maso Canali Pinot Grigio. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes. This wine is well-balanced and full-flavored with hints of nectarine. Pair it with seafood and light poultry for a delightful meal.","price":"$14.79","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448945-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/maso-canali-pinot-grigio-2011/118957"}]},"instructions":"Special equipment: 12 metal or wooden skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes)              Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium low.                          Arrange the shrimp on the skewers, leaving a bit of space between each one. In a small bowl, vigorously whisk the lemon juice and olive oil. Brush this on both sides of the shrimp and let rest just 1 minute.                          Put some Sunny's 1-2-3 BBQ Sauce in a bowl for brushing on the shrimp; reserve the remaining sauce in a separate bowl for serving.                          Grill the shrimp until they just begin to turn color and become only slightly opaque. As this happens, flip the skewers and begin to brush right away with my 1-2-3 BBQ Sauce. Cook until the shrimp are almost completely opaque, just a few minutes more. Remove to a plate and cover lightly with aluminum foil to allow them to finish cooking through from the heat of the grill.                          Serve with the reserved sauce on the side.                          In a small saucepot over medium heat, add the shallots and enough olive oil to just coat them. Season with a pinch of salt and more pepper than normal. Saute the shallots until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add the ketchup and cook until it loses its bright red color, a few minutes more. Add the brown sugar and cook until it dissolves and blends in with the sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Taste again for seasoning.
