In the bowl of a stand mixer (preferably a Bosch) using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and honey.Add the eggs and mix until combined.  Add the milk, vinegar, and yeast mixture.  Stir until combined.Stir the flour and measure 3 cups into a bowl. Stirring helps incorporate air into the flour so you don't get a dense bread.  Add the salt and stir it into the 3 cups of flour.  Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour, mixing for 5 minutes until a soft dough is formed.  The dough may look sticky, but if touched your finger, should come away clean.Pour 1 Tbsp of oil into a large bowl.  Scrape dough out of the mixing bowl, and into the bowl with the oil. Flip the dough over so all sides of the dough have oil on them.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  You will need one large roll (2 1/2-inches round), one medium roll (1 1/4-inches round), and one small roll (1/2-inch round) for each bunny’s body and then two (2 1/2-inches long) “snake” shaped pieces of dough for the ears.  Keep the unused dough covered with a towel or greased plastic wrap while you work on each bunny.Shape rolls into round, seamless pieces by creating a circle with one hand, touching your thumb and pointer fingers together.  Push the dough through the center of the circle with your other hand. Finish pinching the bottom of the roll together.Use large (2 1/2-inch) rolls for the body, medium (1 1/4-inch) rolls for the head and small (1/2-inch) rolls for the tail.  Place the pinched sides of the rolls on the bottom, touching the baking sheet that has been sprayed with pan spray, lined with parchment paper, or lined with a silicone baking mat.  Place the 3 rolls side-by-side, touching each other, with the largest roll in the middle, so as the dough rises, they will stick together.Loop the pieces for the ears and press them against the body and on top of the bunny’s head with a toothpick that has been dipped in flour. Dip the toothpick in flour again and poke two holes for eyes.Keep the finished bunnies covered with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with pan spray as you work, so they don’t dry out.  Repeat with the remaining dough to create as many bunnies as you can (about 16 to 20 bunnies), spacing them a couple inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  Keep the bunnies covered with the greased plastic wrap, and let the dough rise for 1 hour or until double in size.Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown. Remove from the oven and brush melted butter over the top.  Enjoy Warm!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Dissolve the yeast in the water in a small bowl, set aside.
