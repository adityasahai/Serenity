Gently muddle to bruise basil. You do not want to rip the basil apart in the shaker. Just gently release the delicious basil flavor. Add in ice and vodka. Add shaker lid and shake until cold. Pour into short cocktail glass and add more ice if needed. Add rhubarb bitters and give a quick stir. For rhubarb syrup:Add all ingredients to a pot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook till thick, about 20 minutes. Pour through a fine strainer, gently pushing the fruit to extract all the juice. I like to press a little firmer on my fruit so my syrup is more cloudy because more solids make it into my syrup. If you want a clearer syrup make sure to not press any of the solids through the strainer.
