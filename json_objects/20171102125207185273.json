and Malbec. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Gnarly Head Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442127,"title":"Gnarly Head Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Gold Medal Winner: 2014 Los Angeles International Wine CompetitionGnarly Head 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon is King - big, gallant and powerful. This dark, bold Cabernet has solid tannins and jammy fruit, with aromas of black cherry, blackberry, freshly-cracked black peppercorn, violet and charred notes. On the palate, flavors of dense black fruit compote and currant followed by a trio of clove, spice and earth, lead to a generous, lingering finish.Try pairing this Cabernet with grilled lamb skewers, strong cheeses or a spaghetti Bolognese.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442127-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gnarly-head-cabernet-sauvignon-2012/129675"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small saucepan, combine the water, vinegar and sugar.
