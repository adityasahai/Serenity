Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Port, and Moscato d'Asti. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Spray a9x5-inch loaf pan with floured cooking spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside. Loaf- To a largebowl, add the eggs, sugar, sour cream, and whisk vigorously until smooth and combined. Drizzle in the oil while whisking to combine. Add the lemon zest, lemon extract, and whisk to combine. Note - I used 2 tablespoons of lemon extract because no actual lemon juice is used in the loaf and I found 2 tablespoons lemon extract necessary for full-bodied lemon flavor, but add to taste. Don't use lemon oil and lemon extract interchangeably because they're not; oil is much more potent and intense. Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and stiruntil just combined,don't overmix. Some lumps will be present and that's okay, don't try to stir them smooth. Turn thebatter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Bake for about 50 to 52minutes, or until top isdomed, set, and toothpick inserted in the center crack comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs but no batter. In the last 10 minutes of baking, tent pan with foil (loosely drape a sheet of foil over pan) to prevent excessive browning on the top and sides of bread before center cooks through. Allow loaf to cool in pan on top of a wire rack for at least 30 minutes (I cooled 4 hours)before turning out onto rack to cool completely before glazing. Lemon Glaze- To a small bowl, add the confectioner's sugar and slowly drizzle in the lemon juice while whisking until smooth and combined. You may need to play with the sugar and lemon juice amounts a bit as necessary for desired consistency and flavor. Evenly drizzle glaze over bread before slicing and serving. Extra glaze can be spread on the cut surface of the bread like you'd spread butter on toast and it soaks right in making the bread even moister and more lemony. Or you can halve the glaze recipe if you're not a glaze person. Breadwill keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 daysor in the freezer for up to 6 months; I don't recommend storing it in the fridge because it'lldry out.
