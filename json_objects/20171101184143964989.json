Vin santo is typically sweet with notes of baking spices and nuts, so it pairs really well with pumpkin spiced desserts. A good sparkling Moscato would work too, and if you feel like splurging, an ice wine. The Nacina Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Monterey with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431397,"title":"Nacina Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Monterey","description":"Nacina, Wein der Eisbox, made from Danny's Vineyard late harvest Gewürztraminer and frozen post harvest is our tech savvy answer to global warming.
