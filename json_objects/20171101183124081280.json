If you want to start with dry bulgur, soak bulgur with equal amount of boiling water (1:1) and a pinch of salt.  It will take about 30-45 minutes to absorb the water and then it’s ready.Add washed/rinsed chana dal (kadalai paruppu), 1 cup of water, turmeric and little salt in a pressure cooker.  Also add the ginger, if using.  I always use ginger while cooking lentils and legumes to aid easy digestion.  Leave it for only one whistle and remove the cooker from the stove to stop the cooking process.  If you cook it for more than 1 whistle the daal will become mushy.  After the opening the cooker drain the daal in a colander.  No need to reserve the water.Once you have the bulgur and channa daal ready, in a frying pan heat the oil.Once the oil is hot add the mustard seeds and hing.  After it splutters add the green chillies.  I used one chili, split in half.Now add the drained channa daal, little salt and fry for a minute.  After that also include the prepared bulgur and combine it thoroughly.  Leave it in the stove for another minute.Switch off the stove and add the grated coconut and mix it well.  Garnish it with chopped coriander.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"I used leftover bulgur which I had prepared already.
