Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Soak the sweet potato noodles with hot water around 30 minutes. Transfer out and set aside. In the serving bowls and mix all the seasonings. Heat up peanuts oil in pan to stir-fry the mashed garlic until aroma. Mix the garlic oil with the seasonings. Add some spring onions and corianders in serving bowls. Pour in boiling water or stock to tune the seasonings. Add vinegar and light soy sauce. Mix well and set aside.
