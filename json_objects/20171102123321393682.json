Set aside.Put water and margarine in a glass measuring cup and microwave just until the margarine has melted. Remove from microwave and stir. Add milk, stir. Add other wet ingredients and whisk to combine.With the stand mixer running (using the paddle attachment), pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Scrap down the bowl if you have to.Allow to mix on medium speed for 3 minutes.Take a piece of plastic wrap and lay it out on a slightly damp counter top, so it covers an area bigger than 8\" x 16\". Sprinkle 2 Tbsp of sugar on the wrap. Lay ball of dough on top of that. Gently lay another piece of plastic wrap over the top of the dough. Pat the dough down into a roughly squarish shape. Lift and reposition the top plastic wrap whenever you need to. Roll the dough out (with the plastic wrap on top) to a square approximately 8\" x 16\".Remove plastic wrap. Spread filling mixture evenly across dough's surface. Leave 1 1/2\" along one long end without any filling, this is where your orange rolls will be sealed.Starting along the long end, use the bottom sheet of plastic wrap to lift the edge of the dough and roll it up, forming a long cylinder. Start with the edge that has filling on it, that will be the center of your finished rolls.Using a long piece of dark thread (light colours can be lost in the dough), cut the long \"orange roll log\" into 8 pieces, about 1 1/2\" wide. You can do this by placing the thread underneath the roll, crossing it at the top, and pulling the threads so they cross each other, pulling it through the dough. This way, you won't be squishing your dough down by cutting with a knife. Place rolls in prepared pan, with cut side up. I like to push the rolls down to about 1\" high.Allow the orange rolls to rise in a warm, draft free place for about 30 minutes, or until nearly double in size.Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the tops are a nice golden brown.While rolls are baking, in a small sauce pan, combine the glaze ingredients. Bring to a boil and allow to boil for 1 1/2 minutes. Spoon the glaze over the buns when they are still hot.These are best served warm, however, I had great success with reheating them in the microwave for a few seconds when they were a day old as well.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of your stand mixer, mix all dry ingredients until combined.
