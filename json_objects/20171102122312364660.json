A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428725,"title":"NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled","description":"A personal favorite of our director of wine production Jonathan Hunt. Put your feet up after work or after dinner, sip our Ruby Port, and relax. This wine features rich berry notes and a long, smooth finish. Our smooth and hearty Ruby Port begins with a blend of Corot Noir and Chambourcin wines. We then fortify the blend with 100% grape brandy (distilled spirits) and sweeten it to bring all the flavors into perfect balance. Serve at cool room temperature.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428725-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Country-Vineyards-Finger-Bottled/dp/B00OGL9P14"}]},"instructions":"Place the cashews in a small bowl, cover with water and soak for 4-6 hours, or overnight. Brew 8oz of strong coffee or espresso (such as 1 Nespresso Caramelizio pod). Let cool completely at room-temperature or in the fridge.When the coffee has cooled, drain the cashews, rinse lightly, and add to a high speed blender. Add the remaining ingredients, and blend on high (or use the liquify setting), for 2-3 minutes, until smooth, creamy, and completely combined.Place in the fridge for at least an hour, or until fully chilled. Add to an ice cream machine and churn according to manufacturers directions, generally 18-25 minutes, until the ice cream has thickened and resembles soft serve. Transfer to a freezer safe container (I like to use these pint containers or a 5x9-inch loaf pan). If your container does not have a tightly-fitting lid, press a piece of parchment paper against the surface. Freeze until set, about 4 hours.Remove from the freezer 10-15 minutes before serving. Homemade ice cream is best the day of, but will keep frozen for up to a week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the cashews in a small bowl, cover with water and soak for 4-6 hours, or overnight.
