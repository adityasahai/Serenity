Stir in walnuts. Drizzle apple-juice concentrate and 1 tablespoon oil over dry ingredients and rub in with your fingers until crumbly. Set aside.Preheat oven to 350F. Coat two 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.To prepare bread: Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar, increase speed to medium-high and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/2 cup granulated sugar (or 1/4 cup Splenda), beating until stiff peaks form.Combine buttermilk (or yogurt), 3 tablespoons oil and vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk the remaining 1/2 cup sugar (or 1/4 cup Splenda), all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; add the wet ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined. Fold in apples, then the beaten whites. Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, smoothing the tops. Sprinkle with the reserved streusel. Bake the loaves until lightly browned and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
