Sift together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda. Beat in the dissolved espresso powder, vanilla, and egg whites. Fold in the chocolate chips and slivered almonds. Use a 1-tablespoon scoop to measure the batter out onto the 2 baking sheets, leaving about 2 to 3 inches between each cookie. Bake until the cookies are set on the outside, but look a touch doughy in the center, about 8 to 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely on the trays before removing with a thin metal spatula, and remove them slowly as they have the tendency to stick if you go too fast.For the filling, cream together the clarified butter, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt. Beat in the powdered sugar and then gradually beat in the milk a little at a time until it reaches your desired consistency.Use the filling to sandwich 2 cookies together.
