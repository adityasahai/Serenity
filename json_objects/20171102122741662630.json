Try pairing with Sparkling Wine. Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Mumm Napa Cuvee M with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":451872,"title":"Mumm Napa Cuvee M","description":"The naturally ripened fruit selected from more than 50 separate vineyards, reveals layers of crisp and creamy textures that are rich and lingering. Individually selected lots were kept separate during initial fermentation in order to highlight their vineyard differences and extract the quintessence of their specific strengths. The resulting blend is a soft and elegant wine that highlights the delicious and powerful ripe fruit flavors that characterize the world-class grapes of the Napa Valley.Cuvée M exhibits a graceful stream of very fine bubbles gently rising to a persistent mousse cordon with a light peach rose color. The aromas are elegant, rich and complex, showing fresh white and yellow stone fruits with subtle hints of wild strawberry. A light touch of fresh brioche, with hints of vanilla and honey add to the wine's complex bouquet. On the palate, full flavors of peach and pear combine with a creamy caramel character, which lingers into a long satisfying finish.Mumm Napa's Cuvée M is the perfect sparkling wine for champagne cocktails or as an apéritif to pair with hors d'oeuvres. It is also a perfect match with creamy desserts and spicy foods.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/451872-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/mumm-napa-cuvee-m/80229"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.                          Drizzle olive oil over the mushrooms and asparagus on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast until a nice color is achieved, about 12 minutes. Set aside.                          Beat together the eggs with some salt and pepper in a bowl. (Do not over-beat; just mix until the eggs mostly come together.) Stir in the Monterey Jack, Parmesan and hot sauce and set aside.                          In a large ovenproof nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and golden brown, several minutes. Add the diced potatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir to cook for a couple of minutes. Finally, add the asparagus, mushrooms, olives and roasted red peppers and cook, stirring, until everything is hot.                          Make sure all the ingredients are evenly distributed across the bottom of the skillet, then pour in the egg mixture so that it evenly coats everything. Let it sit on the burner for 30 to 45 seconds to set the edges, then put the skillet in the oven. Cook, watching it carefully, until the eggs are set but not very brown on top, 10 to 12 minutes.                          Slide the frittata out of the skillet and onto a cutting board. Sprinkle on the basil and slice into wedges with a long serrated knife.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":450.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Drizzle olive oil over the mushrooms and asparagus on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast until a nice color is achieved, about 12 minutes.
