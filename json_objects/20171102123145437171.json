Add sausage and mash with stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no greater than 1/4-inch). Cook, stirring frequently until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onions, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Add parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer contents to a large bowl and set aside until completely cool.                                                                                    2                                                                                                                                                                                                   While filling cools, make knots. On a lightly floured surface, divide dough into two even pieces. Working one piece at a time, roll or stretch into an oblong strip about 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. With a bench scraper or knife, cut crosswise into 12 strips. Repeat with other half of dough.                                                                                    3                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tie each strip into a knot and transfer to bowl with sausge mixture. Toss and fold with your hands until every knot is thoroughly coated in mixture. Grease a 9- by 13-inch casserole pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Transfer the knots to the casserole dish in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil, cover tightly with plastic, and set aside until doubled in size, about 4 hours. Alternatively, refrigerate until doubled in size, 12 to 16 hours.                                                                                    4                                                                                                                                                                                                   When ready to bake, preheat oven to 425Â°F and adjust oven rack to center position. Unwrap rolls. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.                                                                                    5                                                                                                                                                                                                   When rolls are almost ready, melt remaining tablespoon butter in the microwave or stovetop. Remove rolls from oven and immediately brush butter. Serve with gravy and cranberry sauce on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add sausage and mash with stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no greater than 1/4-inch).
