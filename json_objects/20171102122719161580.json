Well this is why. WHOOPIE PIES. I have actually never made whoopie pies before these, and was very intrigued by the consistency of the batter when I was scooping spoonfuls of it onto the baking sheet. Somewhere between cake batter and cookie dough, they are like moist little cake-cookies with frosting inside. I really can't think of anything I'd rather eat, especially when it combines pumpkin, maple, chocolate, and cream cheese. You don't see chocolate and pumpkin paired up together too often, and it is a real shame. The flavors go remarkably well together and are both relatively inexpensive ingredients to use. I would highly recommend making these for a Halloween party or Thanksgiving, as they are very fun to eat and also look super cute. Also, I used a mix of whole wheat and white flour for this recipe just to make it a bit healthier but without too much of a wheat-y taste, but feel free to use whichever of the two you prefer. Makes about 18 whoopie pies.Ingredients:Pumpkin Maple Whoopie Pies2 Eggs2 Cups Whole Wheat Flour1 Cup White Flour1 and 1/2 Cups Sugar1 Cup Pumpkin Puree1/2 Cup Butter1/2 Cup Oil1/3 Cup Maple Syrup1 Teaspoon Baking Soda1 Teaspoon Baking Powder1 Tablespoon Cinnamon1/2 Teaspoon Cloves1/2 Teaspoon Allspice1/2 Teaspoon Ginger1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla ExtractChocolate Cream Cheese Filling1 Egg White2 and 2/3 Cups Powdered Sugar8 Ounces Cream Cheese4 Tablespoons Butter1/4 Cup Cocoa Powder1 Teaspoon Vanilla ExtractBegin by making the whoopie pies. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. In a large bowl mix together all of the liquid ingredients until well blended. Add all of the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined.Scoop a tablespoon of the batter and place it onto a well-greased cookie sheet, making sure to place each tablespoon at least 3 inches away from the others, as the whoopie pies will spread out when they bake.Place the pan in the oven and bake for 12 - 15 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and allow the whoopie pies to cool for 20 minutes before attempting to remove them from the pan.To make the filling, beat the egg white and vanilla extract together on high speed for 1 minute, or until the egg white mixture becomes slightly stiff and shiny. Add the cream cheese and butter and continue to beat until the mixture becomes relatively smooth. Add the powdered sugar and blend until thoroughly combined. Then add the cocoa powder and blend until the coloring is consistent throughout the filling. Set it aside.To assemble the whoopie pies, simply place a teaspoon to a tablespoon (depending on your filling preference) of the filling onto the bottom side of one of the whoopie pies. Place another whoopie pie on top and voila, you made a complete whoopie pie! Continue to repeat this process until all of the whoopie pies have been assembled.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remember when I told you to hold onto any leftover pumpkin puree you had?
