Sprinkle in the chilled butter pieces and pulse to combine, until the butter pieces are the same size as large peas.Pour in the water and sour cream mixture and pulse a few more times, until the mixture starts to come together. I don't wait until the air dough forms a ball, since it might become too wet. As soon as the pie dough starts to come together, I gather it onto the center of a floured counter and knead it just a few times to bring it all together.Divide the dough in half and form it into a disc and then wrap it into parchment paper or aluminum foil. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or store it in the freezer for up to 1 month. As I said, I usually make the pie dough the night before I plan to make the pie.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.Roll out one of the discs of the pie dough into a 12-14 inch circle. Ease it gently into a deep dish pie plate. (You can also use a regular pie pan, you will just not use all of the filling to fill up the pie.)Place the pie plate into the refrigerator while you make the rest of the filling.In a standing mixer, combine the softened cream cheese, the sugar, egg, lemon zest, vanilla extract and cornstarch until the mixture is smooth. Pour it into the pie crust. Place back into the refrigerator or freezer.In a large bowl, combine the berry filling. You can use just about any fresh berries that you like - raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc. Gently mix the blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and cornstarch. As the berry filling stands, the cornstarch will dissolve. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the berry filling on top of the cream cheese filling, leaving behind the extra liquid. Don't just dump in the berry filling, because otherwise the berry part will be too watery in the pie. For this same reason, don't use frozen berries for this recipe. They have a lot more water in them than fresh berries, which are watery to begin with, so if you use frozen berries, you will end up with a soupy pie.Dot the 2 Tablespoons of butter over the surface of the berries.Place the filled pie into the refrigerator while you work on the top crust. You can just trim the edges of the bottom crust and crimp the edges, and not use the top crust at all and after baking, you can add some whipped cream on top of the pie.Roll out the second pie crust and make it into a lattice top, or whatever kind of topping you like. There are tons of tutorials online for creative pie crust creations. I made two braids that I incorporated into the basket weave lattice topping, and placed another braid around the edge of the pie crust, crimped the edges and cut out some leaves to place on the top crust.Brush the top of the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with the 2-4 teaspoons of granulated sugar. Place the pie on top of a rimmed baking sheet, in case the berry filling will spill out as it bakes. Bake for 45-60 minutes in the preheated 400 degrees Fahrenheit oven, depending on how golden you want the pie crust to be. I like mine really golden and crisp, so I baked it for the full hour.Take the pie out of the oven and cool until completely cooled before serving it, otherwise the pie will fall apart and leak all over the place when you try to cut into it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"I prefer to make the pie crusts in advance, so I usually make them the night before or even 2-3 days in advance.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk the ice water and sour cream in a small bowl or measuring cup until combine and set it aside.In a food processor, add the flour, sugar and salt until evenly mixed.
