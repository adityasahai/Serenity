A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Add yogurt, orange peel, vanilla essence and Cointreau.Sift the flour with salt and baking powder and fold it into the batter. Finally add the melted butter. Stir until you'll get a smooth and heavenly scented batter. Now add the apples, peeled and cut into cubes, and gently stir them in.Butter 8 ramekins and dust them with breadcrumbs and cane sugar. Do not skip this step: it will add a nice crispness to the cakes and prevent them from sticking to the ramekins.Spoon the apple batter into each ramekin, filling them up almost to the edge. Decorate each cake with a few slices of apple and sprinkle them with some cane sugar.Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown on top and slightly moist inside.
