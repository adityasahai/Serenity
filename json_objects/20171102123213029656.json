French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. You could try Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 103 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431104,"title":"Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend","description":"Raspberry and cherry with notes of violets lift from the glass and mingle with soft spice and toasted oak on the nose. Smooth, lush flavors of blackberry, black cherry, and cassis wrap around a core of full, yet soft, structured tannins.
