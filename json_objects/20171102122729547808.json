Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Process until mixture is well combined and smooth.Chill mixture in fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until slightly firm.Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Using a spoon or spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop equal sized balls of the Oreo cookie mixture, placing on prepared baking sheet. Place sheet with cookie balls in freezer until well chilled, at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.When cookie balls are chilled, melt chocolate by combining chopped chocolate and oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl.

Remove with fork, gently tapping off excess chocolate. Place back on cookie sheet and immediately sprinkle with reserved crushed candy canes.
