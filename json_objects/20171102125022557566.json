Saut until the mixture is fragrant, 1-2 min.Add the diced tomatoes along with the curry powder, chili powder, garam masala, coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Cook for 4-5 min, until the tomatoes start to break down.Add the seared meat and diced potatoes to the pan along with  c of water. Bring the mixture to a simmer.Cover and simmer over low heat for 30-40 min, until potatoes are cooked and the meat is tender. Check the curry occasionally during cooking and add a little water if it seems to be getting too dry.Towards the end of cooking time, mix in the vinegar and salt.While the curry is cooking, slice the loaves of bread in half and hollow each half out, creating two cube-shaped bowls out of each loaf.
