Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel.

Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.                            Combine ground venison and ground beef in a bowl. Divide into 4 balls, and flatten into patties.                            Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place the burgers in the heated skillet and sprinkle each burger with salt, black pepper, a dash of beer, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Flip the burgers once a brown crust has formed on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the cooked side of the burgers with the salt, pepper, beer, and Worcestershire. Cook burgers another 5 to 10 minutes for well done. Top each patty with bacon and serve on hamburger buns.
