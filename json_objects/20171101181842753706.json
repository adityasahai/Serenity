A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428725,"title":"NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled","description":"A personal favorite of our director of wine production Jonathan Hunt. Put your feet up after work or after dinner, sip our Ruby Port, and relax. This wine features rich berry notes and a long, smooth finish. Our smooth and hearty Ruby Port begins with a blend of Corot Noir and Chambourcin wines. We then fortify the blend with 100% grape brandy (distilled spirits) and sweeten it to bring all the flavors into perfect balance. Serve at cool room temperature.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428725-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Country-Vineyards-Finger-Bottled/dp/B00OGL9P14"}]},"instructions":"Freeze the freezer bowl 24 hours prior to making ice cream. Wrap in a plastic bag so the bowl stays clean.In a blender, add mango, ¼ cup sugar, and lemon juice and puree until texture is smooth. Set aside.In a large bowl, combine heavy whipping cream, milk, and the remaining ½ cup sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar.Stir in the pureed mango and gently stir to mix.Cover and chill the mixture in the fridge for at least one hour. I put it in the freezer for one hour.Set up the ice cream maker and press On. When the freezer bowl begins to turn, pour the mixture through the ingredient spout. Mix about 30 minutes or follow manufactures’ instructions.If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and store in the freezer for 3 or more hours before serving. My end result was still loose similar to frozen yogurt’s texture so I had to freeze it a couple more hours. Then it tasted perfect!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Freeze the freezer bowl 24 hours prior to making ice cream.
