Make sure they are evenly spread out on the baking sheet. Roast almonds at 250F for 8-10 minutes. Let cool for 5-10 minutes.Once the almonds have cooled, transfer into a small food processor. Process on high for about 5 minutes, scraping the sides. At this point, if your almond butter has not started to become a nut butter consistency, add in a teaspoon of coconut oil at a time. I used 3 teaspoons. Whirl until drippy.Once the almond butter is at the desired consistency, add in paste from 1/2 a vanilla bean and give it one last whirl to mix it all together. Store in an airtight container or jar. Best if kept in the refrigerator or a dark place.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, preheat oven to 350F.
