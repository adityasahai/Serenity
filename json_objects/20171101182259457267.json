Sparkling wine--with our without orange juice--is an obvious choice for eggs. With buttery hollandaise sauce, though, you might opt for a fuller white wine like chardonnay.

Add the corn, peppers, shallots and garlic to the dry ingredients and mix until combined. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the eggs and milk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix with a spoon until just combined.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add oil. Use a 1/3 cup measure and scoop corn cake batter into the oil, leaving about an inch in between each corn cake. Cook until the cakes begin to set and bubble on the top, about 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the corn cakes with a spatula and place on a plate or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter.Note: I fry the bacon beforehand and set it aside (read: you can fry the corn cakes in the bacon grease...) and heat the water for the poached eggs while the corn cakes are cooking. avocado hollandaiseAdd the avocado, lemon juice and hot water into a food processor or high powered blender and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides if needed. With the processor running, stream in the olive oil slowly. Continue to blend until pureed and smooth. Poach the eggs and assemble the corn cakes. Break a piece of bacon and set it on top of the corn cakes and cover with a poached egg. Pour the avocado hollandaise overtop and sprinkle on some crushed red pepper. Top it off with some fresh herbs if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"corn cakes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking soda, salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornmeal.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the corn, peppers, shallots and garlic to the dry ingredients and mix until combined.
