White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Bake or saute until cooked through. Allow to cool slightly, and dice into small bite-sized pieces.Spray skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.While skillet heats, start assembling your quesadillas. Spread about 2 tbsp. refried beans evenly over one half of the tortilla. Arrange diced chicken over the beans, sprinkle ¼ c. of cheese over the chicken, and spread 1-2 tsp. drained salsa over the cheese. Fold tortilla in half.Place quesadillas in the hot skillet as you make them and have room. (This is a bit of an assembly line process.) Allow to cook 3-5 minutes before carefully flipping each quesadilla over. The first side should be nice and brown. Cook 3-5 minutes on the opposite side until both sides are brown and the cheese is melted. Transfer cooked quesadillas to a clean plate or cutting board.Continue making, flipping, and removing quesadillas until they are all cooked. Cut each quesadilla into halves or thirds before serving.
