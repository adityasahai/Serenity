Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).                            To Make Mushroom Filling: Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, salt and pepper and saute together, stirring, until mushrooms are dark. Remove skillet from heat; stir in nutmeg and 3/4 cup bread crumbs.                            Spoon mushroom mixture onto the end of each chicken breast, roll up and fasten with toothpicks. Place seam side down in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Brush 1/8 cup melted butter over breasts, then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs. Pour cream over all.
