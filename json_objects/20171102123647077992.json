A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent. A sweet entry leads to a rounded, lush, moderately full-bodied palate with a lengthy, flavorful finish.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428475-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/NV-Solera-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00HSME8OW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F. Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, optional salt; set aside. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the next 5 wet ingredients (through vanilla). Add the wet mixture to the dry, mixing lightly with a spoon until just combined. Small lumps will be present and this is okay. Don't overmix or try to stir them smooth; set aside. Fold in 1 cup cranberries and 1 cup white chocolate chips. Turn batter out into prepared pan. Evenly sprinkle 2 tablespoons cranberries and  2 tablespoons white chocolate chips over the surface, pressing them down very lightly with a spatula or your fingertip. Bake for about 36 to 38 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter (I baked for 36 minutes). Watch your cake, not the clock, and always bake until done, whatever that means in your oven with the brands of ingredients you used. Place pan on a wire rack and allow cake to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Optionally, dust with confectioners' sugar or a simple glaze. This vanilla cream cheese glaze, this buttery vanilla glaze, or this browned butter glaze are all excellent, quick, and easy glazes. Cake will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days.
