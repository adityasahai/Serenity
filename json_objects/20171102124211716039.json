great choices for Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis.

It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 69 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430749,"title":"Dumas Station Minnick Hills Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"This wine features fruit aromas of cassis and blackberry. Additional aromas include classic Walla Walla dusty spice box, plus pencil lead and leather. This is a rich and meaty wine, with layers of complexity. Our Minnick Hills Reserve will benefit from decanting while young, and maintain its solid structure for years to come. \"The scent of this wine reminds me of my first leather jacket-a Navy pilot's vintage aviator jacket, purchased at our local surplus store.

Increase heat to high and bring to a boil; reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the veal is tender. 20 minutes before the stew is done, add the potatoes to the Dutch oven, recover, and cook until the potatoes are fork tender.After the potatoes have been added to the stew, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms in a single layer, taking care not to crowd them, and cook, turning frequently, until the mushrooms are nicely browned. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Once the meat and potatoes are done, remove them from the Dutch oven using a slotted spoon and add them to the mushrooms in the sauté pan; keep warm. Pick the thyme sprigs and bay leaf from the the liquid in the pot (you may also remove the celery if you wish).Whisk egg yolks and coconut milk or heavy cream together in a bowl, and slowly stir into the liquid in the Dutch oven.
