Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444296,"title":"Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio","description":"The 2012 wine is deep straw-yellow in color.

Special equipment: skewers              Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.                          In a medium saucepan add the butter, hot sauce and chili powder over medium-high heat. Once the butter melts, add the garlic and vinegar, and saute until it sizzles and is fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Reserve a few tablespoons of the sauce for a later use.                          Stick 3 shrimp on each skewer. Sprinkle the shrimp with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the shrimp on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, basting with the sauce the last few minutes of grilling.                          Remove the shrimp to a platter and drizzle the reserved sauce over the skewers. Serve the shrimp skewers with carrots, celery sticks and creamy blue cheese dressing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: skewers","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/wooden-skewers.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404648,"name":"grill pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill-pan.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"In a medium saucepan add the butter, hot sauce and chili powder over medium-high heat.
