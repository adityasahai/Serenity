Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe.
