Place remaining bread on top of sandwiches, butter side up. Turn the skillet on medium-high heat. I like to start with a cold skillet because it gives the cheese more time to melt as the skillet heats up, and the butter will still help the bread get crispy. This method ensures a crispy sandwich with super oozy, melty cheese! (YUM).Cook sandwiches 2-3 minutes on each side or until bread has lightly browned and cheese has melted.
