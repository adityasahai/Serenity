A crisp dry white wine balances out the richness of a creamy carbonara. Frascati is a Roman wine, which makes it an especially fitting choice to the Roman dish. One wine you could try is Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"1.  Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Spoon off and discard all bacon fat from the pan except for 1 tablespoon.2.  Add garlic and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the skillet and saute for 30 seconds.  Add wine to the skillet and simmer until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.3.  Stir water, broth and pasta into the skillet.  Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until the pasta is tender and the liquid has thickened slightly (15 to 18 minutes). Remove the skillet from heat.  Meanwhile, whisk cream, eggs and cheese together in a small bowl.  Mix the liquid slowly into the pasta and toss to combine.  Add the bacon and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, 6 to 8 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
