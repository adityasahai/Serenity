Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent. A sweet entry leads to a rounded, lush, moderately full-bodied palate with a lengthy, flavorful finish.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428475-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/NV-Solera-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00HSME8OW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 325F.  Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Place melted butter and agave nectar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Mix on medium for  two minutes, until combined and uniform in color. Meanwhile, put the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and kosher salt into a mixing bowl and whisk until uniform. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Add vanilla and mix.  Add flour in one addition and stir until almost mixed.  Add pistachios and cranberries and stir just until combined. Use wet hands to form into two logs, each about 12 inches long and three inches wide. Sprinkle the tops of the logs generously with palm sugar and press lightly into the dough.  Bake for 20 – 25 minutes, until the log is set and brown.  Remove from oven and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes.  Turn the oven down to 300F. Slice biscotti into ½ inch pieces with a sharp, serrated knife at a 45 degree angle.  Lay flat on the cookie sheet and return to the oven for 12 – 15 minutes until lightly browned.  Flip cookies and bake for another 12 – 15 minutes.  Biscotti should be firm all over and yield very slightly to gentle pressure in the center.  Let cool on a wire rack.  Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to two weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325F.
