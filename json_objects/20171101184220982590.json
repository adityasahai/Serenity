White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, oil, shallots, lime zest, ginger, garlic, turmeric, cumin and cilantro. If using only chicken or beef, transfer the mixture to a gallon-size sealable plastic bag and add the chicken or beef. If using both chicken and beef, divide the marinade between two gallon-size bags and add the chicken to one and the beef to the other. Seal the bag(s) and marinate refrigerated for at least 1 hour or up to a day ahead. Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce. In a large saucepan, combine the coconut milk, peanut butter and chicken stock and whisk to blend. Cook over medium heat until the mixture simmers, stirring often to prevent scorching, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato, turmeric, cumin, garlic, curry paste, if using, and sugar and mix well. Simmer until the flavors have blended, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. If the sauce is too thick, add up to a cup of water and blend. Cover and refrigerate the sauce for up to 2 days, or keep at room temperature if making the satays immediately. Just before serving, reheat and blend in the lime juice and cilantro. Thread the strips accordion-style onto the skewers, one type of meat for each. Preheat and outdoor grill or the broiler or heat a grill pan or large heavy skillet over high heat. If using a skillet or grill pan, spray the interior with nonstick cooking spray or spray the outdoor grill rack; if broiling, line a baking sheet with foil and spray. Broil or grill, turning once, until the meat is just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer skewers to a warm platter and serve with the sauce.
