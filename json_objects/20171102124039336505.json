A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the egg, yogurt, milk and lemon zest; set aside. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are no larger than the size of small peas. (If you prefer, you could also combine the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor and pulse to blend.)Add the strawberries to the flour mixture and toss to coat.  Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the dry ingredients and gently fold together with a fork or spatula until a sticky dough has formed. Knead the dough a few times to ensure that all the dry ingredients are incorporated and the dough is cohesive.Transfer the dough to a well floured work surface and pat into a disc about 7-8 inches in diameter. Sprinkle lightly with additional sugar.  Cut the disc into 8 wedges.Place the shaped scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake until lightly browned on top, about 15 minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
