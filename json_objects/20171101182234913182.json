Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Remove from microwave and let sit for 1 minute then stir until smooth and no lumps remain. If needed microwave for an additional 20 seconds. Set aside to cool.  Cream together butter and sugars in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Add in eggs and vanilla, beat well. Add in cooled semi-sweet chocolate. and mix well.  Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Slowly add flour mixture to your dough, making sure to mix well and scrape down the sides of your bowl.  Fold in Milk Chocolate Chips. Refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours before baking.  When ready to bake, spoon dough by rounded tablespoon ( I use a medium cookie scoop) onto parchment lined baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool on baking tray for 5 minutes before removing to racks to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place semi-sweet chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl, pour milk over top and microwave on high for 1 minute.","ingredients":[{"id":19903,"name":"semisweet chocolate","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/microwave.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from microwave and let sit for 1 minute then stir until smooth and no lumps remain.
