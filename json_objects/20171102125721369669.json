Add the corn syrup, melted butter, 1 tablespoon milk, and vanilla. Whisk the ingredients together, adding extra milk or glazing (powdered) sugar by the teaspoon to adjust the consistency as needed. (Yields 1/2 cup glaze, enough for 6 doughnuts.)For the Chocolate Glaze: Place the chocolate chips and butter in a small sauce pan over low heat. Gently heat and stir, just until the butter melts. Remove from heat and stir until all of the chips are melted. Stir in the corn syrup, adding extra as needed to create a smooth, shiny glaze. (Yields 1/2 cup glaze, enough for 6 doughnuts.)To Frost Doughnuts: Place a wire cooling rack on top of a baking sheet. Set aside. Gently dip one flat side of a baked and (mostly) cooled doughnut into the glaze and swirl gently. Lift and turn the doughnut glaze side up, brushing away excessive drips from the bottom with a butter knife. Set doughnut on the wire rack to finish dripping. Sprinkle immediately with desired toppings. Let glaze set and repeat with remaining doughnuts.For Cinnamon Sugar Topping: Place Cinnamon-Sugar in a large plastic bag (stir to combine if using regular sugar and cinnamon). While baked doughnuts are still warm, lightly with melted butter and place in the plastic bag. Seal bag tightly. Shake and turn the bag gently to coat the doughnuts. Remove from bag and serve. (Yield: Cinnamon Sugar for 6 doughnuts.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Vanilla Glaze: Sift the glazing (or powdered) sugar into a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the corn syrup, melted butter, 1 tablespoon milk, and vanilla.","ingredients":[{"id":19350,"name":"corn syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Remove from heat and stir until all of the chips are melted.
