A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Use remaining batter for cupcakes, or if you have extra ramekins you can make more cakes! Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25-30 minutes.Transfer to a wire rack and cool.Once cool, run a butterknife around sides of cakes and remove from ramekins.Trim the tops off of each cake to make 2 even flat surfaces on top and bottom. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Add chocolate and butter and ¼ cup warm water to a glass/metal bowl over a small saucepan filled with simmering water over low heat (the bowl should NOT be touching the water) or double boiler.Heat chocolate until melted. Remove from heat once melted and cool for 10 minutes.In a small heavy saucepan, whisk egg yolks, sugar and remaining water over low heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees F, about 1-2 minutes. Do not keep your eyes off or stop mixing because egg yolks will cook and cause the mousse to be lumpy. Remove from the heat and whisk into chocolate mixture.Cool for 5-10 minutes.In a chilled mixing bowl, whip heavy cream on high speed until peaks form. Fold chocolate in whipped cream with a large spatula. Refrigerate for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cake decorating bag with a hole in the top.Cut two strips of parchment paper or wax paper double the height of the cake (or more if you are making more cakes) and wrap around base of each cake. Tape to hold together in a circle. Use the cake decorating bag filled with mousse to pipe mousse on top of cake staying inside the wax paper circle until you reach the top or desired height of mousse. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, then remove wax paper carefully and serve with chocolate shavings or fruit as topping/garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Spray 2 ramekins with cooking spray and set on a baking sheet.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404781,"name":"ramekin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ramekin.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add flour, cocoa, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a standalone mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment and whisk until blended.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add egg, milk, oil, vanilla, and ¼ cup water and mix on medium speed until smooth and combined, ~ 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Pour batter into ramekins until a little more than ½ filled.
