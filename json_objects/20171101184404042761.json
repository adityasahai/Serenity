After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439521,"title":"Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot","description":"Taltarni Three Monks is a Cabernet-Merlot blend that combines two very compatible grape varieties sourced from Victoria. It is set to complement Taltarni's reputation for remarkable Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.The medium-bodied palate is soft, smooth and fills the mouth with ripe berry flavours which are complimented with subtle oak and vanilla. The finish is fresh and clean.Designed for perfect enjoyment on release, it will also reward cellaring. It is an ideal choice matched with lamb veal or your favourite à la Carte meal, such as beef Carpaccio.Blend: 52% cabernet, 48% merlot   ","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439521-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/taltarni-three-monks-cabernet-merlot-2001/85340"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400. If using pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's cold and heat it up at the same time. Make sure to freeze your steak for about an hour before cutting. (Freezing it will help cutting it thinly.)Slice partially frozen steak as thin as possible. Slice green pepper and onion thinly as well and set aside. Preheat some oil (about a tablespoon or two) in a medium frying pan, over medium heat and saute steak, peppers and onions with some salt and pepper until steak is no longer pink. Strain juice and set the mixture aside. Divide pizza dough in two halves. Roll out the dough but not too thin or it will rip. Spread some cheese in the center of calzones and divide Philly Steak mixture among them. Add remaining cheese on top and bring the edges of pizza dough together. Press the edges, sealing them well. You can also braid the edges or fold them in to secure the filling.Be careful and use oven mitts! Sprinkle the hot pizza stone with cornmeal and place calzones on top. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Once baked, brush calzones with some olive oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400.
