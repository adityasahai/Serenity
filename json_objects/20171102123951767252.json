Add the ginger, the cinnamon, the cloves and the nutmeg. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg with the vanilla and the molasses until it is all smooth. Whisk in the milk until it is completely incorporated with the molasses mixture. Slowly stir the molasses mixture into the flour and spice mixture. Stir just until combined, there will be some lumps.Heat your griddle over med-high heat. Brush your griddle with some butter. Add about ¼ cup of batter to the griddle for each pancake. Lower the heat just a bit to about medium. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancakes and they begin to brown just a bit around the edges, this is about 2 minutes, and then flip them over and cook them on the other side for around 2 minutes more. Watch them closely as they do burn more easily than regular pancakes.When you finish them, if you need to keep them warm a little longer, preheat your oven to about 250 degrees and set them on a pan and keep them toasty in there until you’re finished making the rest.These are amazing with just syrup, but we often top them with powdered sugar and whipped cream, we use fruit toppings, your possibilities really are endless.
