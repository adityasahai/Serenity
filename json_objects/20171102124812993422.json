Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

They all of a sudden look fancy. I just noticed I needed to add more egg to my edges in this picture. So, yeah… add egg, make sure you add more than I did to make edges stay closed.Place your bites of heaven in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10-12 minutes or until the wonton is how you enjoy it. I have discovered that if I leave the wonton in the oven about 15 minutes and spray the top, I can get it kinda crispy, but I actually like ti softer, so I tend to eliminate the cooking spray all together and pull them out at about 11 minutes so they are still easier to eat. It’s your choice.Eat and enjoy! They are addicting.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grab a cooking pan and spray it with a light coating of cooking spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place a Wonton wrapper on the pan (or as many as you plan to make).In the center of the Wonton wrapper add 1 teaspoon of Nutella.Next, place the banana slice on top of the Nutella.Then, dip your finger into the beaten egg and glaze the edges of the wonton wrapper.Bring all of the corners into the middle and press them all together.
