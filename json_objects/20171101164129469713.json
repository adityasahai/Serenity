In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until crumbly. Add the buttermilk, eggs and yeast mixture; stir to form a soft dough. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight.                                                                                           In another bowl, mix the filling ingredients. Punch down dough; divide into three portions. On a sugared surface, roll one portion into a 12-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Sprinkle 1/3 cup filling lengthwise down one half of the dough. Fold dough in half over filling, forming a 12-in. x 4-1/2 -in. rectangle; pat down to press filling into dough. Seal edges.                                                                                           Sprinkle an additional 1/3 cup filling down one half of the folded dough. Fold in half again, forming a 12-in. x 2-1/4-in. rectangle. Press to form a 12-in. x 4-in. rectangle. Cut into twenty-four 1/2-in. slices. Repeat with remaining dough and additional filling. Twist each slice one time and roll in remaining filling; place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets.
