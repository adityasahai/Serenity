for Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438039,"title":"Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"337 Cabernet Sauvignon exudes vibrant aromas of black cherry, ripe currant, fresh herbs and lightly roasted coffee. Smooth tannins and balanced acidity support core flavors of blackberry, black cherry and chocolate, intertwined with spicy black pepper accents on the finish. This wine can be enjoyed on its own or with herb-roasted pork loin, baked chicken or barbecued steak and sauteed mushrooms.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438039-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/noble-vines-337-lodi-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/165669"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            For the stew: Heat 1 teaspoon fat in a 5-quart Dutch oven on medium heat until lightly smoking. Add sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate to drain (leave excess fat in pan).                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Add onions to pot and cook, stirring frequently, until deep brown, about 20 minutes, adding 1 tablespoon of water if onions start to burn.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Swirl to coat bottom of pan. Add drained dumplings and cook until lightly-browned on all sides, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes total.
