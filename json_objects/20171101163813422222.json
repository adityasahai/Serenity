Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/robert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999/51817"}]},"instructions":"In a shallow bowl, combine the garlic, fajita seasoning, grape-seed oil and cilantro. Toss the steak to coat in the marinade. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place the butter, olive oil, and onion in the skillet. Season with salt, stir and cook until the edges of the onion are deeply golden yet still a bit firm, about 10 minutes. Add the peppers and cook for 5 - 6 minutes more, depending on how you want them. Transfer the onion and peppers to a small dish. Working in two batches, sear the steak on both sides for 3- 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 8 minutes before slicing into thin strips. Return the strips and any juices from the cutting board to the skillet, squeeze in the juice from the lime wedges and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Serve with warm tortillas, guacamole, cotija cheese and pico de gallo.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a shallow bowl, combine the garlic, fajita seasoning, grape-seed oil and cilantro.
