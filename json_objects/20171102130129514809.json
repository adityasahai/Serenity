Lasagna pairs well with medium-bodied red wine with higher acidity. Sangiovese, Montepulciano, and Chianti all fit the bill. The Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447010,"title":"Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo","description":"At 1,000 feet above sea level, Valle Reale's vineyards are nestled into one of Italy's most beautifulnational parks. This rich 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is made from the oldest estate vineyards,planted back in 1975 on soils rich in chalk, clay and pebbles. Harvested by hand in the second partof October, the grapes are gently pressed and macerated with the skins for 1012days to ensureideal color concentration and structure. After full malolactic fermentation in barrels, the wine ismatured for one more year in the same French barriques and then refined in bottle for another eightmonths.Valle Reale introduces the wine lover to a new breed of Montepulciano. Surprisingly concentrated,with silky tannins and layers of dark berry fruit and spices, this is a rich and aromatic Montepulcianod'Abruzzo. Fullbodiedand firm, yet supple, it is ready to be enjoyed with hearty pasta dishes,roasted poultry or lamb, and ribs.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447010-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/valle-reale-vigneto-di-popoli-montepulciano-dabruzzo-2006/104761"}]},"instructions":"Brown your ground beef with your onions in a pan.Add the beef, onions and all your seasonings to the slow cooker and let it cook on low for at least 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4. *NOTE: If you follow the recipe measurements, you will have about double the amount you need for the lasagna.
