Blanc are great choices for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir.

Remove the skin and bones from the chicken breasts, leaving the wing bone attached. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, sour cream, mustard, parsley, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper.
