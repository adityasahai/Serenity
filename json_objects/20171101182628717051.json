Lightly brush a baking sheet with olive oil.In a food processor, pulse toasted wheat bread to a fine crumb. Measure out 2 tablespoons into a small bowl; discard remaining breadcrumbs or save for another use.Add  cup chickpeas and green onions to food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Add to small bowl with breadcrumbs along with dill weed and lemon juice; stir to combine.Add remaining chickpeas, mashed peas, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper to food processor; process until smooth (add a splash of olive oil if needed to make sure mixture is smooth and not dry). Add to small bowl with chickpea-onion mixture and stir until well combined.Form mixture into 12 small patties, each about -inch thick. Place on prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush tops of patties with olive oil. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, flipping patties halfway through until golden brown and baked through.Meanwhile, make the yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, combine yogurt, garlic, curry powder and red pepper flakes. Serve with patties.To make the sweet potato oven fries: Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Toss sweet potato sticks with a little olive oil and a dash or two of curry powder; spread in one layer on a baking sheet. Bake on a rack in lower third of oven 20 minutes, then transfer sheet to a rack in upper third of oven for 7 to 10 minutes, until fries are baked through and crisp on the outside.NOTE: The patties also freeze really well in an airtight container for up to 2 months, so feel free to double or triple the recipe to keep some on hand.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 400 degrees F.
