Try pairing with Cabernet Sauvignon, Chablis, and Malbec. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew.

It has a dazzling ruby hue and a fresh, balsamic nose with an elegant body and complex flavors of spicy red fruit, herbs and licorice.Outstanding with grilled poultry, mushrooms and sweet red peppers.\"One of the most idiosyncratic wines from Chile, Domus grows high up the Andean foothills in the outskirts of Santiago. The vines are refreshed by winds coming off the mountains, and capture an Andean character of eucalyptus and herbal aromas in their grapes. The wine feels soft and round, with bright acidity and a generous core of red fruit. It finishes with hints of leather and mocha. Delicious now, this will age with grace.\"-Wines & Spirits\"Alluring, with mint, sage and warm cocoa aromas leading the way for dried currant, licorice, loam and coffee notes.
