Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"In a large pot of boiling salted water, add the shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a bowl of ice water to chill.                          Drain the shrimp, cut into 1-inch pieces, and transfer to a bowl. Add the lime, lemon, and orange juice, stir to combine, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 6.                          Stir the tomato, onion, cilantro, and chile into the shrimp mixture and let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.                          When ready to serve, gently stir in the avocado and cucumber. Divide the ceviche among 8 chilled martini glasses and tuck 2 to 3 tortilla chips around the sides of each.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large pot of boiling salted water, add the shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
