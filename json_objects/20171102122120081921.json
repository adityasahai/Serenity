Pat the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits. Press together the scraps of dough and repeat the process. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; brush the tops with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the biscuits until lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
