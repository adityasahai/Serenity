Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment, silpat liners or lightly grease with cooking spray.In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, place the 4 ounces chocolate and the butter. Microwave on low power for one minute intervals until the chocolate and butter are melted and combined, stirring after every minute of cooking. Take care not to microwave at too high of power or the chocolate can scorch. Let the chocolate mixture cool slightly, then whisk in the brown sugar, egg and vanilla. Beat the mixture until it is well combined.Gradually stir in the flour mixture. Add the chocolate chips and mix. Roll the dough into about 16 balls (12 to 14 if you want larger ice cream sandwiches). Roll each ball of cookie dough in the sugar. Transfer the dough balls to the prepared baking sheets, placing about 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until they are puffed, 12 to 15 minutes.Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Repeat with the remaining dough. When the cookies have all cooled, place them in the freezer in an airtight container until they are very cold.Remove the cookies from the freezer and working quickly, arrange half of the cookies bottom side up and top each with a small scoop of ice cream in the middle of the cookie. Top with a second cookie and press together lightly. Wrap each in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 1 hour.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325ºF.
