Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet (reserve the skillet).                          Mix the parmesan, oregano, lemon zest and garlic in a small bowl. Sprinkle on the pork chops. Bake until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest 5 minutes.                          Meanwhile, add the figs and 3 tablespoons water to the reserved skillet. Cook over medium-low heat until the figs are soft and most of the water has evaporated, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and add the arugula, fennel, croutons, the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and the lemon juice; toss. Serve with the pork.
