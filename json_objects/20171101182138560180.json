White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"In a bowl, marinate the meat in the Seasonings for a few hours.While you are waiting for the pastry sheet to be half thawed, start cooking the filling. In a frying pan, heat oil on medium high heat and cook the chicken. When it starts to change color, add the mix vegetables and a little bit more of Tandoori mix. When everything is cooked, turn off the heat and set aside to let it cool. * Please note: the picture shows double amount.Place the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface and use a fork to prick the pie sheets if your pie sheets are not docked. Then cut them into 9 circles per sheet using a (2½ inch diameter) round cookie cutter. Roll up the scrapes into a ball and re-roll them and cut into circles.Preheat the oven to 400F degrees. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl.Place half of the pastry circles (26 circles for me) onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Then put a small amount of filling in the center and brush the edges of the pastry circles with the egg wash using a pastry brush.Put remaining pastry circles on top of the filling and press the edges of circles firmly to seal with a fork.Using a kitchen knife, make 2 small slits on top of the pastry and brush the top of pastries with the egg wash using a pastry brush.Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the pastries are nice golden brown on the top. Remove from the oven and let the pastries cool slightly on wire cooling rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl, marinate the meat in the Seasonings for a few hours.While you are waiting for the pastry sheet to be half thawed, start cooking the filling.
