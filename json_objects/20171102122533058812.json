A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Line a standard 12 hole muffin tin with cupcake papers.Put the diced Rudi’s Multigrain Gluten-Free Bread in a large bowl and set aside.Combine 1/2 cup light coconut milk and the palm sugar in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 45 seconds and stir until the palm sugar is dissolved. In another medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 3/4 cups light coconut milk, eggs, vanilla, and sea salt. Whisk in the warm coconut milk and palm sugar.  Pour the mixture over the Rudi’s Multigrain Gluten-Free Bread, add the shredded coconut, and stir to combine.  Allow to soak for 20 minutes, or until the Rudi’s Multigrain Gluten-Free Bread is fully saturated.Use a standard spring-release ice cream scoop to divide the batter evenly between the prepared cups. The cups will be nearly full.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cupcakes are slightly puffed, golden brown, and set in the center. The center of the cupcakes should read 200 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.Let cool for 5 minutes in the cupcake tin then transfer to a paper towel lined wire rack to cool completely before frosting.  Do not frost while still warm.Put the macadamia nuts, light coconut milk, agave nectar, virgin coconut oil, and sea salt in a high powered blender.  Start on low speed and increase to high, scraping down as necessary, and processing until completely smooth.  Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.Take the 2 cans of full fat coconut milk out of the refrigerator (they must be cold for this to work!) and carefully open them. The fat from the coconut will have risen to the top and solidified. Carefully remove the fat from the top of the can being careful not to get any of the liquid underneath.  Put the coconut fat into a large bowl and whip on high speed until light and fluffy and approximately double in volume.Remove the chilled macadamia cream from the refrigerator. Stir 1/4 of the whipped coconut fat directly into the macadamia cream.  Fold the remaining whipped coconut fat in 2 – 3 additions.  Spread on top of cooled cupcakes or use a fancy pastry tip to pipe frosting on top. Sprinkle the toasted coconut flakes on top of the frosted cupcakes for garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
