Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

It's also an ideal aperitif.","price":"$8.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438682-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/tiamo-pinot-grigio-2008/98091"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Put all ingredients in a large ziplock bag, mix to coat shrimp.
