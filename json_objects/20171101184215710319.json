Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. You could try Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"doughIn a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas - this specific dough will yield one pizza large enough to feed about 3-4 people) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees. (If I use my pizza stone, I heat my oven to 475 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. If you're just using a baking sheet, follow the directions below for baking and set to 425 degrees.)pizzaChop the kale into slices and shreds with your knife, then place it in a bowl. Add the olive oil, honey and chili garlic paste then toss well to coat. Massage with your hands for 2 to 3 minutes, then let it sit until ready to use. Add the ricotta to a food processor and blend until it's smooth and creamy. Add in the cheese, salt and pepper, pureeing again until combined.Brush the pizza dough with the olive oil. Spread 1/2 of the whipped ricotta on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch at the edge of the crust. Cover the ricotta with the shredded kale, then add scoops of the leftover ricotta on top of the kale randomly. Sprinkle the fontina on top. Bake for 25 to 30 minute (or a little less if using the stone) or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Remove and let cool slightly before serving. Top with the extra parmigiano-regianno and crushed red pepper flakes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"dough","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky.
