Gingerbread Cake. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.
