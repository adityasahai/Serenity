Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Add the sour cream, egg, and vanilla.  Mix well.In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Add dry ingredients to bowl of wet ingredients and mix until just incorporated.Roll out dough onto a lightly floured surface until 1/4-inch thick.  Cut circles out and place onto a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.  Press scraps together and continue cutting cookies until all the dough is used; try not to overwork the cookie dough.Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 8 minutes.  Allow to cool on tray for a few minutes before transferring cookies with a spatula onto a wire rack.While cookies cool, prepare The BEST Cream Cheese Frosting and place it in a pastry bag with a coupler and a large round tip.  Pipe a thin layer of frosting in a swirl motion on each cookie starting from the outside, and working your way in towards the center.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve.
