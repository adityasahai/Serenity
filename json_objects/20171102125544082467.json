Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439141,"title":"Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio","description":"It has a straw yellow color.

If you want to make them into taco shells, hang on rack and bake for 5 minutes on 170C.Mix sliced cabbage, cider vinegar and salt in a small bowl.Heat a non-stick pan with 2 teaspoons of olive oil to medium high heat. Pat dry the fish fillet with a paper towel and place the fish on the pan. Cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillets  1 minute on each side for a thin fillet and a couple of minutes of thicker fillet. Fish should be still barely translucent when cooked. Remove from pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.To assemble, place the fish, salsa, cabbage, and avocado onto each flatbread taco with a piece of lime. Or place each ingredients on the table and let everyone assemble their own taco.   Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If the salsa is a little too spicy or sour for your taste, adding some diced avocado will temper it.Mix all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, the dough is moist and goey. Divide dough into 4 portions.  Place 1 portion of dough between 2 sheets of non-stick baking paper, flatten it with a chopping board (or something flat and heavy), the thickness should be about 2-3mm. I find this method makes a round shape than using a rolling pin to flatten it. If the thickness is thinner, I find the dough will break when I peel off the paper.  Heat up a non-stick pan on low heat. Remove the top baking paper on the flattened dough, place the uncovered part onto the pan and peel off the bottom layer of baking paper. Cook for about 1 minute and flip over the flatbread with a flexible spatula and cook for another minute.  Continue with the rest of the dough.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare oat flatbread as per recipe.
