Try pairing with Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc. Chowder can benefit from a crisp white to cut through the rich, creamy broth - or you can go big or go home with a rich, buttery chardonnay. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"Slice the bacon into -inch pieces. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon until crisp. Transfer the bacon to a plate topped with a paper towel to drain and set aside. Reserve the bacon drippings in the pan and cook the onion in the bacon drippings until tender, about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add the corn kernels, diced potatoes, carrot, celery and half of the chopped bacon to a 4 or 6 quart slow cooker. Add the cooked onions. Pour the AlmondBreeze over the soup ingredients and add the bay leaves, kosher salt and marjoram. Stir gently to mix.Cover and cook on high for 3 hours or on low for 6 hours, or until the potatoes are fork tender.In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with  cup of the broth then stir into the rest of the soup. Cook for 30 minutes or so more until the soup thickens.Remove the bay leaf and use a potato masher to gently smash the soup to thicken a bit more. If the soup seems to break or separate because of being cooked too long, stir in a  cup or more of AlmondBreeze.Season to taste with more kosher salt. Serve hot topped with chopped bacon.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Slice the bacon into -inch pieces.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon until crisp.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Transfer the bacon to a plate topped with a paper towel to drain and set aside.
