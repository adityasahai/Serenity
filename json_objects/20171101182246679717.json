A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Set aside. Shortly it will become gelatinous.Place the almonds in the food processor. Pulse a couple of times until ground. Add the gluten free flour, cinnamon, salt, sugar and butter. Pulse for few seconds. Add the flax meal mixture and pulse until the dough comes together making a ball. Take the dough out of the food processor, wrap it in clear foil and place in the fridge for about 30 minutes. When chilled, with your fingers and the back of a spoon (i find it works just great) rolls the crust in a greased 11 inch tart/quiche pan. Cover again with plastic foil and chill for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile heat the oven to 400F. When the crust is chilled place the blueberries on top of the crust, top with slices of bananas and sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake for about 30 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl mix the flax meal with the water. Set aside.
