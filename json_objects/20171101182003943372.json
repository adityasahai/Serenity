Try pairing with Albarino, rosé Wine, and Sauvignon Blanc. These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more. One wine you could try is Salneval Albarino. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 9 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":446012,"title":"Salneval Albarino","description":"Light straw in color, the nose of this Albariño is seductive with honey, pear and tropical fruit and a slight mineral component. It is racy andzesty with citrus and floral flavors in the mouth, yet is round and soft at the same time.It matches perfectly with fresh seafood and shellfish; is an ideal accompaniment to salty, spicy Asian cuisine; and is also great on its own as a cocktail wine. Truly adventurous food lovers will amaze and inspire their friends by serving it with the unlikely, but fantastic pairing of traditional barbequed ribs with a sweet, slightly spicy tomato based sauce.","price":"$9.39","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446012-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/salneval-albarino-2008/98474"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a nonstick Dutch oven, saute the chicken, sausage, onion, green pepper and celery in oil until chicken is no longer pink.
