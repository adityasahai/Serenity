If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

In a liquid measuring cup measure out the warm water and add the 2 teaspoons of oil. Check the temperature with your fingers or an instant read thermometer.Pour the liquid into the dry mixture, add the egg white and stir until combined.Gradually add in the remaining 1 - 1 cups of flour ( I add  -  cup at a time) until the dough forms a ball. Add the sun dried tomatoes to the dough, fold it once or twice in the bowl to incorporate, and then turn the dough out onto a floured surface.Knead for about 6 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and springs back lightly when pressed with two fingers (I actually only had to knead for 3-4 minutes to achieve the right texture).Cover the dough with a towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.Cut the dough into thirds. Then cut each third into fourths, yielding 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 10\" rope (I do this with floured hands to make it a little easier).Place the breadsticks on a greased baking sheet -- if you have to crowd them it's fine, but you will have to pull them apart after they bake. 2\" between each breadstick will prevent them from baking together.Brush the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoion oil and sprinkle all over with the Parmesan cheese.Cover the breadsticks again with the towel and let them rise in a warm place (I use my stove top) for about 30 minutes, until they double in size.Preheat the oven to 450F. Bake for 10 - 14 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl whisk together 1 cup of the flour, sugar, Fleischmann's Rapid Rise Yeast, and salt.
