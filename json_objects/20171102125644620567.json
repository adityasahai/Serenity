A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a 9\" springform pan with parchment paper or foil, letting the paper cover the edges of the bottom of the pan and closing the springform edge around it (this makes for easy removal later on).Combine the crushed chocolate grahams and melted butter until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press into the prepared pan.Beat the softened cream cheese and sugar until fluffy. Add the unsweetened cocoa and mix until combined, making sure to scrape down the sides and the bottom at least once.Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition. The mix in the vanilla, salt and heavy cream.Add the red icing color until the batter is a deep red color. I started with  teaspoon and ended up using maybe  -  teaspoon total.Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread it over the crust.Bake for 20 minutes ate 325F. Then reduce the oven temperature to 225F and bake for 30 more minutes. Turn the oven off and DO NOT open the oven door. Just let the cheesecake stay in there until the oven cools to room temperature. This prevents cracking.Use a knife to gently loosen the sides of the cake from the pan before popping the springform sides open.To make the gel frosting, stir together the cold water and cornstarch until smooth. Pour it into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Pour in the corn syrup and stir until the mixture is heated through and smooth. You will need to stir frequently; you can watch it thicken as it cooks.Remove the mixture from the burner after 1-2 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and red icing color. I used about  teaspoon of color to achieve the look here. Let the gel cool before spooning it over the cake.Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325F.
