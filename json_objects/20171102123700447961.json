Fruity, low tannin zinfandel is great for any sticky, saucy barbecue chicken dish. If you're not feeling red wine, a sparkling rosé will work too. The NV Zombie Zin Zinfandel with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428186,"title":"NV Zombie Zin Zinfandel","description":"The Zombie Zin is sporting a new label design with a torn look, that suggests a window into another world. The colors are more vibrant earth-tones and the capsule is a deep red. The grapes for the Zombie are sourced throughout California, mostly from the dry, hot sandy soils of the Delta region and the Central Valley. The final blend benefitted from some inky Syrah grapes that came from the Central Coast. The wine was fermented in Stainless Steel and aged for about a half a year in American oak. The Zombie Zinfandel is very dark in color, almost a black-purple. The aromas are of ripe, dense black fruits and a hint of dried herbs. The flavors are complex and rich, sporting succulent blackberries, powdered cinnamon, cola and cherry jam. Just a hint of black pepper in the long finish.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428186-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Zin-California-Zinfandel-Wine/dp/B009W6M43O"}]},"instructions":"Preheat grill to 350 F degrees.Wrap each chicken breast with a slice of bacon, stretching it to ensure wrapped tightly.
