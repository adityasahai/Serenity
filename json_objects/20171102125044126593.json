Grill pizza dough according to Grilled Pizza Tutorial. Alternatively, pizza crust can be baked in oven according to package directions. But, to be honest, in the summer grilling just feels right.  A few minutes before crust is fully cooked, top with pizza sauce, radishes, carrots, shallots, peas, salami and cheese. Cook until toppings are warm and crust is cooked through. Remove from grill. Sprinkle pizza with parsley, if desired. Slice and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Go out and fire up the grill.
