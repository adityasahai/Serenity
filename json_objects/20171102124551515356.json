Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. The Double Canyon Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441790,"title":"Double Canyon Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"This Cabernet embodies an enticing array of ripe red and black plum, intermixed with notes of fresh red cherry. Characteristic of the appellation and 2014 vintage, the nose offers spiced potpourri with a touch of raspberry preserves. The addition of Syrah leads to a full and rich texture on the mid-palate, further accented by bright acidity from the Petit Verdot, sweet red fruit from the Merlot and luscious blackberry notes supplied by the Malbec. The soft and supple mouthfeel is supported by the complexity of sweet oak tannins and fresh fruit character, finishing with the juicy acidity that is characteristic of Horse Heaven Hills.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441790-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/double-canyon-horse-heaven-hills-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/160719"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                                                                            In a large bowl, combine the egg, 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce, bread crumbs, salt and pepper.
