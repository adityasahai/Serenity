A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Place the pecans (from the pecan filling) onto a small baking sheet and cook until brown and nutty smelling, about 5-10 minutes. Watch them closely as they burn quickly. Once cooked, set aside and reduce the oven temperature to 350.In a small bowl whisk together the 3 Tbsp of flax meal with 7 1/2 Tbsp warm water. In a separate, small bowl, whisk together the flax meal and water from the pecan layer. Put both bowls in the refrigerator to gel.Drain the cashews and add them, along with all the remaining ingredients (except the flax egg) into a high-powered blender and blend, scraping down the sides as necessary, until smooth and well combined. Set aside.Stir together the coconut sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil and salt from the pecan layer in a small pot set over medium heat. Stir it occasionally so that the coconut sugar melts.Bring the pot to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Transfer to a hot pad to cool for 5 minutes.However, while the coconut sugar is melting and you're waiting for it to boil, it's time to make the crust.Beat together the coconut oil and maple syrup using an electric hand mixer. Stir in the coconut flour and salt until a wet dough forms.Press the dough evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch spring-form pan and bake until lightly golden brown about 7-8 minutes. Your crust will probably rise during baking. Just use a small spoon (or your fingers) to firms press it back down, making sure not to crack it.When there are about 2 minutes left for the crust to bake, stir the flax seed mixture (with the 3 Tbsp flax meal!) right into the blender (you can use a bowl if you wish, but it's more dishes.) You want the cheesecake ready to pour over the crust AS soon as it's out of the oven, or I've found it doesn't adhere to the crust properly.Once the crust is out, and you've pressed down any risen areas, pour the cheesecake layer immediately over top and spread out evenly.Buy this point, your pecan layer should have chilled for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining flax egg.Roughly chop the toasted pecans and stir them into the mixture as well.Gently spread this over top of the cheesecake layer.Bake the cheesecake until the middle rises and the edges appear bubbly and set, about 40-45 minutes.Let cool COMPLETELY on the counter, and then cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours to overnight.Slice and DEVOUR! ***","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the pecans (from the pecan filling) onto a small baking sheet and cook until brown and nutty smelling, about 5-10 minutes.
