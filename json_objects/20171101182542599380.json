White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"1  Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper. Stuff with lemon, thyme and half of the garlic, then, using butcher's string, secure the wings and legs to the body. 2 Place chicken in a small roasting pan or large, deep, oven-proof heavy skillet. Surround with the carrots and remaining garlic, then add 1 cup of the chicken stock. Drizzle with olive oil. 3 Roast the chicken for 15minutes at 425°F.  If you have a convection oven, you can reduce the heat to 375°F for the remaining time (otherwise, just keep it at 425°F).  Roast until chicken is golden and carrots are well caramelized, 1¼ to 1½ hours; baste,  with broth and pan juices every 15 minutes for the first 45 minutes. Add stock if pan looks dry.  4 Transfer chicken, carrots and garlic to a platter. Discard twine, thyme and lemon, and let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Skim fat from pan juices and discard. Add vinegar to remaining pan juices and serve over the chicken.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1  Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels.
