Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441154,"title":"King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris","description":"Light straw with emerald green hue.

Whisk until combined and set aside. Place two cups of Panko in another dish and set aside as well. Squeeze fresh lemon over the cod and season it with salt and pepper. Slice the fresh cod lengthwise and then cut into nugget like pieces. Dunk the cod into the egg mixture and using a fork remove {drain off any excess} and then place in the Panko. Roll and press the breadcrumbs to help them adhere, then place the breaded nuggets onto prepared pan. Working in batches if needed, bake for 10 minutes.
