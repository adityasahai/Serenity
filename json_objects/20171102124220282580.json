The aromas are a complex mixture of licorice, blackberry, and a whisper of vanilla. The rich jammy taste has hints of licorice, herbs, spice and currants with a lingering finish of almond and anise. Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Chèvre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, then add zucchini with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until it has significantly reduced in volume, forms a loose paste, and is browned slightly on edges.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Transfer mixture to blender and add spices, remaining salt, and cream.
