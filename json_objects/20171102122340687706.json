Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Rombauer Merlot with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447938,"title":"Rombauer Merlot","description":"Enticing and lively red color; beautifully aromatic with black cherry and ripe plum. On the palate a purity of blackcurrant, cedar and mint flavors blend together seamlessly.
