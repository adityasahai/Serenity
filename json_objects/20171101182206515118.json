A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Add the liquid mixture and the currants to the flour mixture; stir just until mixed. The dough will be stiff. If necessary, turn the mixture onto a lightly floured pastry mat or pastry board and and knead gently just until the flour is combined. Do not over-knead as this will make a tougher scone.On a lightly floured surface, shape and pat the dough into a circle or rectangle about  inches thick. Cut into wedges, squares or circles with a floured kitchen knife and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Tip: Scones can be cut into any shape you desire. Use a drinking glass to make circles, or cut into squares or wedges with a knife. Dip the edges of the cutter in flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Do not pat the edges of the scone down; instead leave the cuts as sharp as possible to allow the scones to rise in layers.Bake: Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until the scones are very lightly browned. Remove scones from baking sheets and cool on a wire cooling rack.In a small bowl, combine confectioners sugar and lemon juice. Drizzle glaze over the warm scones.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar; whisk together to mix.With a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.In a small bowl, stir the buttermilk, egg, and lemon zest together.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the liquid mixture and the currants to the flour mixture; stir just until mixed.
