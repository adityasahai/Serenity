Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

In a separate bowl, use the electric mixer to cream the butter and 1/2 cup of the confectioners' sugar together. Add the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients and continue mixing until the dough comes together in a ball.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          Knead the dough briefly on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions. Roll each portion into 1/2-inch diameter ropes. Cut each rope into 2 1/2-inch lengths. Gently roll each length so that the tips are tapered. Place the cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on a sheet pan and curve them slightly to resemble crescents. Refrigerate for 1/2 hour before baking to prevent spreading.                          Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the middle rack of the oven. Cool for 3 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies directly onto a cooling rack. Dust generously with remaining 1 cup of confectioner's sugar. Use the remaining sugar to dust the cookies again just prior to serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: An electric mixer with paddle attachment","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Sift the cornstarch, flour, and salt together in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"In a separate bowl, use the electric mixer to cream the butter and 1/2 cup of the confectioners' sugar together.","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the vanilla extract.
