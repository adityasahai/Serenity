Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. One wine you could try is Viva Diva Moscato Colada. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":465263,"title":"Viva Diva Moscato Colada","description":"Sweet Moscato wine infused with natural coconut & pineapple flavor.
