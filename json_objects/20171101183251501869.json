Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434105,"title":"Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"Intense ruby red color.

Process until the dough mixture leaves the sides of the bowl. Remove to a mixing bowl and knead by hand for a few minutes until smooth. (If the dough is too dry, add a few drops of water.) Divide into 4 equal parts and shape them into discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour.

Using a ravioli cutter or a knife, cut out ravioli squares. Sprinkle with flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
