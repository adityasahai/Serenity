Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. One wine you could try is Perrier-Jouet Nuit Blanche. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 68 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":461023,"title":"Perrier-Jouet Nuit Blanche","description":"The sweeter taste, combined with the rounded and smooth mouth feel give the wine, a full body and richness that makes Perrier-Jouët Nuit Blanche the perfect champagne to awaken the senses.Perrier-Jouët Nuit Blanche is an exceptional Non-Vintage blend of 20% Chardonnay, 40% Pinot Noir and 40% Pinot Meunier, sweetened to taste with a 20g/l dosage of cane sugar to create a sensual style.","price":"$67.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/461023-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/perrier-jouet-nuit-blanche/137331"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In an ovenproof skillet, saute onion in oil.
