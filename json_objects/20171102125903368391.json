These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. The Poema Brut Cava with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449764,"title":"Poema Brut Cava","description":"Vibrant aromas of ripe peaches, pears and toasted bread with a hint of spice fill the nose.

Add onions, cook until soft and they start to turn brown (about 7 - 10 minutes). Add garlic, cook for another minute or so. Add the tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder, cook for 2 more minutes stirring constantly. Add tomatoes, liquids, beans and sweet potato, stir until combined. Add quinoa, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover slightly ajarand cook for 30 - 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Chili is ready when sweet potatoes are tender. Add additional water if chili is too thick for your liking. Serve with optional garnishes. You may also like to top it with this easy Cilantro Lime Cashew 'Sour Cream'.Notes: As with all recipes, adjust seasoning to taste. Add a 1/2 teaspoon or so chipotle powder for some added heat. Also, use whatever beans you prefer. You may even like to use one kind of bean instead of two.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In large pot or dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/dutch-oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onions, cook until soft and they start to turn brown (about 7 - 10 minutes).","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add garlic, cook for another minute or so.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder, cook for 2 more minutes stirring constantly.","ingredients":[{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-powder.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":2026,"name":"onion powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg"},{"id":11887,"name":"tomato paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Add tomatoes, liquids, beans and sweet potato, stir until combined.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Add quinoa, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover slightly ajarand cook for 30 - 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
