potato starch, and add to the bowl of your mixer; mix well.Add vinegar and oil to milk mixture and stir.Add wet mixture to dry ingredients and mix on medium speed or No. 4 of your KitchenAid until well incorporated.Once well mixed add 1/4 cup potato starch.  This will coat the dough so that it will not be as sticky.On a smooth surface lay out 1 or 2 sheets of plastic wrap large enough to cover the size of pizza you wish to create. I like to use extra wide plastic wrap and place it on top of a baking mat.If using, place your pizza stone in a cold oven and preheat oven to 500-550°F (as high as your oven will go; some go even higher). If using a baking sheet, just preheat the oven to 500°F. Using the back of a cast-iron skillet for small pizzas work well, too. Just preheat it in the oven as you would a pizza stone.Divide the dough into 2 separate portions (each making a 10” pizza crust. Roll one portion of your dough on top of a sheet of plastic wrap. No need for plastic wrap on top. Roll the dough into the shape you desire. To lift it to the pizza stone onto the pan, roll it around a rolling pin by lifting the cellophane up carefully, or use a pizza peel. Quickly transfer to hot pizza stone or pan, dusted with corn meal or flour.Brush th e top and edges of your dough with extra virgin olive oil to prevent cracking and help aid browning.Bake the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and remove from oven.Top the crust with your favorite pizza toppings, (sauce, cheese, toppings, and a little more cheese, in that order), and return to oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.Allow pizza to cool for about 5 minutes or more.Slice and serve. Using a pizza slicer really helps, especially if you are using a pizza stone. The slicer may cut into other surfaces.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add yeast and sugar to warm milk, stir and allow to foam for about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk together all the remaining dry ingredients except for 1/4 cup potato starch, and add to the bowl of your mixer; mix well.","ingredients":[{"id":11413,"name":"potato starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add vinegar and oil to milk mixture and stir.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add wet mixture to dry ingredients and mix on medium speed or No. 4 of your Kitchen","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Aid until well incorporated.Once well mixed add 1/4 cup potato starch.
