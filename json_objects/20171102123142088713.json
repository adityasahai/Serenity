Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Arrange cookies on cookie sheets about 1 inch apart.Chill cookies on the sheets for about 15 minutes before baking (This will prevent them from spreading).Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until cookies turn golden brown and smell like toasting nuts, rotating sheets halfway through. Cool sheets on wire racks.Wait until cookies are completely cool before assembling them. Stir the jam to soften it, and spread over half the cookies.
