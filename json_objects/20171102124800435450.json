After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Rombauer Merlot with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447938,"title":"Rombauer Merlot","description":"Enticing and lively red color; beautifully aromatic with black cherry and ripe plum. On the palate a purity of blackcurrant, cedar and mint flavors blend together seamlessly. Soft and supple, this wine has a medium-bodied mouth-feel with plush tannins that integrate with the generous finish.Our favorite pairings for this wine include chicken parmesan, cedar-planked salmon over wild rice, and mushroom pizza.","price":"$25.59","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447938-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/rombauer-merlot-2008/116883"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Sprinkle beef with steak seasoning.
