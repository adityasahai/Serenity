Add the onions, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Saute for 5-7 minutes, until onions have begun to sweat. Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaves and cook down for 25-30 minutes until onions are extremely soft and caramelized (stirring frequently).Add the wine, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer until the wine has evaporated, about 8-15 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and thyme springs. Dust the onions with the flour and cook over medium-low for 5-7 minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste. Add the beef broth, bring to a simmer for 10 minutes (or until ready to serve). When ready to serve soup, ladle about 1-1 1/2 cups of soup into and oven safe bowl or soup crock, top with a toasted baguette slice, 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese, and lastly, 2 slices of provolone cheese. Repeat with remaining bowls of soup. Place all of the prepared soup bowls onto a baking sheet and place in the oven. Broil for 2-5 minutes until the cheese is browned and bubbly (keep a close eye on them).
