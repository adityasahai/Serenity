Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors.

Mix well to combine. Add in cheese, panko, flour, salt and pepper, tossing again to mix. Stir in eggs and buffalo wing sauce until the mixture is moistened, then using your hands, form patties by pressing the quinoa together. I literally squeeze it together into my hands and form a patty, smoothing out the sides. Set the patties on a cutting board.Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add olive oil.
