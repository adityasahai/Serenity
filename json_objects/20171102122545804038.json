and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 250. Place potatoes in a medium pot. Pour in water to cover and add a few generous pinches of salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and gently simmer until a paring knife easily pierces potatoes, 2025 minutes.Meanwhile, place salmon in a large baking dish and coat with oil. Season both sides with salt and pepper; place skin side down and sprinkle with caraway. Bake until a cake tester or thin knife blade inserted laterally through fillet meets no resistance, 2530 minutes. (Fish should be opaque throughout and just able to flake.) While the potatoes and salmon are doing their thing, make the dressing and the horseradish yogurt.Whisk oil and vinegar in a bowl big enough to hold the potatoes. Whisk half of scallions and tarragon into dressing. Set remaining scallions and tarragon aside for serving.Combine horseradish, vinegar, and a large pinch of salt in a small bowl; let sit 5 minutes. Whisk in yogurt and oil; season with salt and pepper.As soon as potatoes are done cooking, drain and add to bowl with dressing. Toss to coat and season with kosher salt and pepper.Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Toss herbs and cornstarch in a fine-mesh sieve. Test oil temperature by adding an herb leaf. The oil should sizzle intensely (it may spatter) and the leaf should darken on contact. Fry herbs in batches until crisp and vibrant green, about 5 seconds per batch. Transfer to paper towels with a slotted spoon. Season lightly with kosher salt. (If youd like to skip this step, we get it. Chop herbs instead.)Dress salmon with fried herbs and sea salt. Toss potatoes to redistribute dressing and top with sea salt and reserved scallions and tarragon. Serve salmon with potatoes and horseradish yogurt alongside.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 250.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place potatoes in a medium pot.","ingredients":[{"id":11362,"name":"potato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour in water to cover and add a few generous pinches of salt.
