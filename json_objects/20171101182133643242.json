and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Make the vinaigrette (see link above for Fran's Vinaigrette).Take each chicken breast and place them, one at a time, in a zip lock bag. Pound the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness using a meat mallet. Cut the chicken breast in half and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken. Pour the flour into another bowl.  Combine the eggs and milk into a separate bowl and beat with a fork until well combined. Combine the panko with the oregano, garlic powder, paprika, sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste; mix well.Dredge the chicken in flour; dip in egg; dredge in panko mixture. Place coated chicken on a baking tray that is covered in wax paper. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken. Place the baking tray into the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This will help the breading stick to the chicken.Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken, cooking a few pieces at a time. Cook for 3-4 minutes; turn chicken over and cook 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.  Place onto a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any remaining grease.Whisk the vinaigrette thoroughly then drizzle it onto the greens, tomato halves, roasted bell pepper, kalamata olives, and feta cheese; toss to coat evenly.Serve a piece of chicken with a large spoonful of greens on each plate. Enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the vinaigrette (see link above for Fran's Vinaigrette).Take each chicken breast and place them, one at a time, in a zip lock bag.
