(In order for this type of yeast to grow, the liquid needs to be between 115 and 125 degrees.)Using a dough hook and with the mixer on medium-low speed, slowly pour the water into the flour and mix until the flour is completely incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the bottom and sides of the bowl, about 6 minutes.Scoop up the dough and shape it into a ball. Lightly grease (using some of the melted butter) the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl and pop the dough, rounded side up, back into the bowl. Cover the top securely with plastic wrap. (I like to use a large rubber band to hold the plastic in place.) Let the covered dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.Using some of the melted butter, generously butter an 9-inch round tube pan. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface (there’s no need to flour—the dough is soft but not sticky) and press to deflate it. Shape the dough into a long rectangle equal to the circumference of your pan (mine was approximately 25\" X 5\").Spread the cooled garlic mixture on the bread to within 3/4 inch of the sides. Roll the dough into a long, narrow rope and place it in the buttered pan.Score the top of the bread if desired)Let the dough rise (no need to cover it) in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 25 minutes. It will fill the pan. Brush the top with melted butter.About 15 minutes before the dough is ready to bake, position a rack in the middle of the oven and the oven to 375°F. When the dough has risen to about 2 inches above the edge of the pan, bake until the bread is well browned and sounds hollow when tapped about 40 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and tip the baked bread onto a rack and remove the pan. Set it right side up and let cool completely. Brush the top with the remaining melted butter.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the garlic and cook on low heat for approximately 2-3 minutes to soften.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and allow to cool.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 tsp of thyme leaves and let sit until ready to use.In a large bowl of electric stand mixer, whisk the flour, yeast, sugar, salt baking powder and 1 tsp of thyme together.Check that the water temperature registers about 120 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.
