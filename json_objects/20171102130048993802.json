A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Whenready, dot a blob of raw meringue ontoeach corner of the baking tray and putthe baking parchment on top – thisway it won’t slip.In a well-cleaned, grease-free bowl,whisk the egg whites with an electrichand whisk until they form stiff peaks.Add the caster sugar, 1 tbsp at a time,continuing to whisk as you go. Themeringue will start to get thick andglossy. Add the brown sugar in the sameway, continue whisking for another1-2 mins until really thick and holding stiff,shiny peaks on the end of your whisk.Now add the cornflour and vinegar, andgive a final whisk until smooth.Using a large metal spoon, pile themeringue onto the parchment-lined tray,using the circle template as a guide tocreate a symmetrical circle. Use thespoon to make a dip in the middle (thiswill hold your cream and fruit later) anda few spikes of meringue around theedges. Place in the centre of the oven,shut the door and immediately turn thetemperature down to 140C/120C fan/gas 1. Cook the meringue for 1 hr 10 mins,then turn the oven off and leave untilcompletely cold (best done overnight).For the topping, put the 100ml honeyin a wide frying pan and heat until saucy.Add the peach slices and cook for1-2 mins on each side, over quite a highheat, until the peaches are sticky but stillholding their shape.
