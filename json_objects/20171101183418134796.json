a rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon bake mats and set aside.In a small bowl wisk together the flour, salt and baking powder. Set asideIn a bowl of a stand mixer combine the butter, palm shortening and sugar and mix on medium until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one. Add in the crushed pineapple and vanilla extract and mix another minute. Add the flour and pineapple juice in two additions mixing until just combinedOn the prepared bake sheets, using a cookie scoop or spoons, place batter in about 2 tablespoonfuls, about 2” apart. Bake for 10 min. Let cool for 5 min and then carefully remove to a cooling rack using a thin spatula to move them being careful not to break. Let cool completely before frosting and assembly.For the coconut marshmallow fillingCombine butter and marshmallow fluff in a bowl of a stand mixer and mix until well combined, 3-4 minutes. Slowly add in the sifted powdered sugar and once that is combined mix coconut extract and the shredded coconut.Assembly: spread about 2 tablespoons of filling on one of the cookies, then top with another and either roll the edges in the toasted coconut or sprinkle it on. Keep refrigerated up to one week in an airtight container. Serve at room temp.Stir together the sugar, honey water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 240°F on a candy/fat thermometer.Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want the egg whites at soft peaks by the time the syrup reaches 240°F. When the syrup is 240 deg immediately remove from the stove and reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle the syrup into the egg whites. Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow crème is stiff and glossy and mixer bowl is cool to the touch, about 7 minutes. Add in the vanilla and whip 2-3 minutes more until the mixture is stiffened back up again. Use immediately or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position a rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.
