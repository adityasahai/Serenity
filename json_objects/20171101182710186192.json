White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Line unpricked pastry shells with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil.
