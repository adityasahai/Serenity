The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. The Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438881,"title":"Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier","description":"The 2014 release of this intriguing blend delights the nose with a charming bouquet of enticing aromas of fresh Meyer lemon, fuzzy peach, ripe honeydew melon and yellow plum, mingled with touches of citrus blossom and white tea. The clean, vibrant palate enters with juicy pomelo, sweet lychee and honeyedtangerine fruits, balanced by vibrant acidity and hints of yellow apple and key lime pie that last through the crisp and refreshing finish.With its balanced acidity, this versatile wine pairs well with a number of dishes, from light salads to seafood to, most notably, foods with a hint of spiciness - its subtle sweetness provides balance alongside a touch of heat. Try Chenin Blanc + Viognier with a flavorful Thai curry, a sushi dish, such asa spicy tuna roll, or seared halibut.

(This can be done by placing the kitchen paper on the cutting board. Then put one slice of meat and layer another piece kitchen paper on top of the meat. Gently press it down to soak up the blood.) Place the meat into a large mixing bowl for marinating.Pour the marinade sauce onto the bowl and marinate the meat. Add the sesame oil and gently mix it into the meat. (I prefer adding the sesame oil separately as opposed to mixing it in marinade sauce. I read somewhere that the oil can prevent the other sauce getting absorbed effectively into the meat.) Cover the bowl with food wrap and leave it for 1 hour at room temperature (or longer if kept in the fridge. If you have some time, you can also marinate it overnight for an extra enhanced flavour).Prepare the vegetables. Thinly slice the onion, carrots and green onion.Preheat the nonstick wok on the stove on high heat for about 10 seconds. Add the cooking oil and spread well with a spetula.Add the meat and vegetables and stir. Cook them on high heat for 3 to 5 mins until the meat is starting to turn brown. Stir occasionally (every 30 seconds) and reduce the heat gradually as the meat & vegetables cook.When the meat is nearly cooked toss in the sesame seeds. By now the heat should be very low. Stir them quickly and turn off the heat.Serve the Bulgogi onto a plate and enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove the blood from the meat with kitchen paper.
