Blanc are my top picks for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add carrots, celery and garlic and sautefor an additional 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chicken stock, chicken, bay leaves, rosemary, salt, thyme, and black pepper, and stir to combine.Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium and stir in the stelline. Continue cooking the soup over a simmer until the stelline reach al dente and are soft yet still slightly chewy, stirring occasionally so that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper or herbs, if needed.Serve immediately, with optional garnish if desired.*The longer this soup sits, the more the pasta will continue to soak up the broth. So if you let it continue to sit and cook after the pasta reaches al dente, you may need to add in more chicken broth to thin the soup out, and add a little more salt, pepper and herbs accordingly.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add carrots, celery and garlic and sautefor an additional 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.","ingredients":[{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add chicken stock, chicken, bay leaves, rosemary, salt, thyme, and black pepper, and stir to combine.Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium and stir in the stelline.
