Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                  Place pine nuts, honey, lemon juice, 1/4 cup olive oil, basil, garlic, and chile in a blender and process until the mixture is pureed.
