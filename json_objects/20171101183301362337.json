Attach a candy thermometer to the side of your pan. Bring to a boil on medium high heat and swirl the pot from time to time but do not mix with spoon. Let the mixture boil until the thermometer shows 236 degrees (this will take about 6 minutes or so, maybe less).Remove the pan for the heat and with a wooden spoon, mix vigorously for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture has thickened and the nuts are suspended in the mixture. The mixture should not be liquidy. Fill heaping spoons with the mixture and drop them on the parchment paper. Take the melted chocolate and drop a dollop on each bite. If you have fleur de sel, drop a few grains on each bite. Place a pecan (the ones you kept aside to garnish) on each of the bites. Chill for about 30 minutes or until they are set.You can freeze them in an air tight container.Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.In a small microwavable bowl, put your chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate) and microwave for 10 seconds at a time, mixing between each time, until the chocolate is completely melted.
