Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.

Cook the ramen noodles (minus the seasoning packs) to very al dente according to the package instructions. Let cool.                          Mix together the peanut butter, lime juice and 1/3 cup Asian dressing. Toss with the cabbage mix and cold noodles. Let sit for at least 30 minutes, tossing a couple times in between.                          Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to broil. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.                          Mix the miso, honey and remaining 2 tablespoons Asian dressing in a small bowl. Season with salt if necessary. Liberally brush both sides of the salmon with the miso glaze. Place on the prepared baking sheet and broil on the middle rack until the fish is browned, the flesh is opaque and the interior is 145 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes.                          Place the cooked salmon on top of the cold noodle salad. Garnish with a liberal sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds and scallion greens.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Cook the ramen noodles (minus the seasoning packs) to very al dente according to the package instructions.","ingredients":[{"id":6583,"name":"ramen noodles","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ramen.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Let cool.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Mix together the peanut butter, lime juice and 1/3 cup Asian dressing.
