A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Alternatively, line a standard 9-round cake pan with foil, and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray.To prepare the cake, whisk together the flour, orange zest, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter, egg whites, and vanilla. Stir in the Greek yogurt, mixing until no large lumps remain. Stir in the honey and orange juice. Alternate between adding the flour mixture and milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, and stirring just until incorporated. (For best results, add the flour mixture in 3 equal parts.)Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350F for 21-24 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the center feels firm to the touch. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.Just before serving, prepare the drizzle by stirring together the stevia and milk in a small bowl. Transfer the glaze to a zip-topped bag, cut off a tiny corner, and drizzle on top of the individual slices of cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350F, and lightly coat a 9-round springform pan with nonstick cooking spray.
