menu? Try pairing with Riesling, Sparkling Wine, and Zinfandel. In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Cold Creek Vineyard Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438970,"title":"Chateau Ste.

Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Add smoked paprika and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Add frozen peas, water, beer, chile and salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 25 minutes without disturbing. After 25 minutes, check rice for doneness. Mixture should be moist, but not soupy.
