Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 43 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Moisten the rim of a wine glass with the lime wedge. Pour a bit of sugar onto a small saucer and then gently press the rim of the wine glass into the sugar to create a sugared rim. Add tequila, Kahlúa, and star anise liqueur to the glass, then pour in the coffee. Top with a couple big spoons of whipped cream and a cherry.
