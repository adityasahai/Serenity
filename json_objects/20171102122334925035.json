Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 375°F.

(Go lightly - you will be seasoning each layer.)Repeat the layers, making 7-10 layers.  Pour any remaining cream over the top of the top layer.  Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue to cook until the potatoes are tender and lightly browned on top, about 30 more minutes.Remove the potatoes from the oven and sprinkle with the shredded gruyere.
