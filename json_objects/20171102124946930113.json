We recommend a crisp, dry white wine such as a Gavi, Albariño, or Pinot Grigio. These wines stand up to the pungent dressing and complement the other flavors. The Salneval Albarino with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":446012,"title":"Salneval Albarino","description":"Light straw in color, the nose of this Albariño is seductive with honey, pear and tropical fruit and a slight mineral component. It is racy andzesty with citrus and floral flavors in the mouth, yet is round and soft at the same time.It matches perfectly with fresh seafood and shellfish; is an ideal accompaniment to salty, spicy Asian cuisine; and is also great on its own as a cocktail wine. Truly adventurous food lovers will amaze and inspire their friends by serving it with the unlikely, but fantastic pairing of traditional barbequed ribs with a sweet, slightly spicy tomato based sauce.","price":"$9.39","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446012-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/salneval-albarino-2008/98474"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                        1 The Dressing                A great Caesar salad gets its swagger froma great dressing. Squeamish about rawegg yolks and anchovies? Sorry. Yolks arewhat give richness to the emulsion, whileanchovies provide a briny blast (and thatwhole umami thing). Here's our go-to recipe:Chop together 6 anchovy fillets packedin oil, 1 small garlic clove, and a pinch ofkosher salt. Use the side of a knife bladeto mash into a paste, then scrape into amedium bowl. Whisk in 2 large egg yolks*,2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 3/4 teaspoonDijon mustard. Adding drop by drop to start,gradually whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil, then1/2 cup vegetable oil; whisk until dressing isthick and glossy. Whisk in 3 tablespoons finelygrated Parmesan. Season with salt, freshlyground black pepper, and more lemonjuice, if desired. Can be made 1 day ahead.                                                            2 The Croutons                Make your own. Tearing, not cutting,the bread ensures nooks and crannies thatcatch the dressing and add texture. Toss3 cups torn 1\" pieces country bread with3 tablespoons olive oil on a baking sheet; seasonwith kosher salt and freshly ground blackpepper. Bake at 375°F, tossing occasionally,until golden, 10-15 minutes.                                                            3 The Lettuce                Use whole leaves from 3 romaine heartsto feed 6 people. They provide the ideal mixof crispness, surface area, and structure.                                                            4 The Cheese                Caesars crowned with a mound of gratedParmesan may look impressive, but all thatclumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead,use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave amodest amount on top for little salty bursts.                                                            5 The Assembly                Skip the tongs. Use your hands to gentlytoss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing,then top off with the shaved Parm.                                                            *Raw egg is not recommended for infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 The Dressing","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"A great Caesar salad gets its swagger froma great dressing.
