If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

Rub the potatoes all over with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and prick each potato 4-6 times with the tines of a fork. Place them directly on the rack of the preheated oven (this yields a crisper skin) and bake for about 45 minutes. The outside will be crisp but a slight squeeze will show a tender inside.Carefully remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool for just a few minutes. Mashing the flesh is much easier with hot potatoes, but don't get a steam burn! I like to hold the potatoes with a kitchen towel while slicing. Slice each potato in half lengthwise. Then cut each half in half lengthwise again.Using a spoon, scrape the flesh from each strip into a medium bowl, leaving a tiny bit on each skin (see recipe photos for an example). Set the skins aside.Mash the potato with the Greek yogurt and cheddar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Keep mashing until the potatoes are smooth. You can mix with a hand mixer if you want it really lump-free.Stir in 3 slices of the cooked and crumbled bacon (save the rest for topping).Brush the flesh side of each potato skin with the remaining olive oil. Sprinkle with a tiny bit of salt if desired. Spoon the mashed potato mixture into each skin and place them in a 9 X 13 baking dish.Scatter the remaining bacon and the crumbly blue cheese over the stuffed skins and bake again for about 20 minutes.Garnish the skins with the green onions and serve with ranch","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 425.
