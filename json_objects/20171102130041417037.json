a liquid sweetener, wait and combine with the wet ingredients)In a separate bowl combine the eggs, almond milk, applesauce, and vanilla.Adding small amounts at a time, combine the wet ingredients with the dry until all is incorporated.Allow the batter to sit for 1 to 2 minutes.Heat a non-stick skillet to medium heat (spray lightly with olive oil spray if needed)Once heated, add in batter (about 2 tablespoons for each pancake).Wait a minute or so and top the pancake with an apple slice (the pancake should be partly cooked at this point and the apple slice will sit nicely on top)Flip each pancake only when the edges are fully cooked, cook for an additional 2 minutes on the opposite side.Repeat until you are out of batter.Top the pancakes with your date paste, and any additional
