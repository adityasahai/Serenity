A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Bake in preheated 350°F oven 10 minutes.For the filling, combine Ricotta cheese, brown sugar, half-and-half, flour, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in large bowl of electric mixer; blend until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time; blend until smooth. Pour over crust. Bake 60-75 minutes or until set, the center will still be a little jiggly. Cool in oven with door propped open 30 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely.With mixer on medium high speed using the whisk attachment, whip the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar until firm peaks form. Spread over the top of the cheesecake and garnish with pecan halves. Refrigerate 4 hours or longer before serving.Make the drizzle by sifting the powdered sugar into a small bowl and slowly adding in half of the tablespoon of milk and all of the Mapleine. Stir completely, and if needed add remaining milk until you get the drizzling consistency you desire. Store in a small container with a lid and drizzle over individual slices as the cake is served.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Lightly grease sides of 9-inch springform pan.
