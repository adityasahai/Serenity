Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441958,"title":"Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The wine at first has a light ruby color. It has aromas of black cherry/cherry and violets with the characteristic Bien Nacido dried herbs and light pepper spice balanced by the toasty oak spice and vanilla influence of French oak barrel aging. There are flavors of cherry and red berry with dried herbs followed by a light pepper spice. The sweet oak spice and vanilla is nicely balanced by the fruit flavors. The wine is concentrated and elegant with a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.","price":"$33.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441958-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/sanctuary-bien-nacido-vineyard-pinot-noir-2007/109741"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 450. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.In a large bowl, toss the tomatoes, peppers and garlic with the oil, salt and pepper. Transfer the oiled vegetables to the prepared baking sheet and spread them into a single layer. Bury the garlic cloves in the tomato halves to prevent them from burning. Roast the vegetables for 20 minutes. Remove once the peppers have started to blacken and the tomatoes have begun to collapse. Allow all of the vegetables to then cool slightly.Transfer the slightly cooled vegetables to a food processor, fitted with a metal blade. Add the cilantro, red onion and 2 tablespoons of the lime juice. Pulse about a dozen times, to achieve the texture of a chunky puree. If the salsa is too thick, add more lime juice. Salt to taste (be generous!). Either serve immediately or cover the salsa and refrigerate it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 450.
