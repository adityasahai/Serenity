Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 58 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435309,"title":"Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot","description":"This wine shows aromas of sweet plum sauce, vanilla, chocolate, cedar and butterscotch with big, forward black cherry and black berry fruit in the mouth. A balanced middle with a hint of toasty oak is paired with a nice bite from rounded tannins, and a long pleasant finish. This wine pairs well with grilled meats and wild game with herb-infused, wild-berry sauces, hearty pasta dishes and Pacific Northwest Salmon.","price":"$57.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435309-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/duckhorn-napa-valley-merlot-1995/26649"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    For the steak: In a large, resealable plastic bag, mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, chiles and ginger. Add the steak to the marinade, seal the bag, and move the steak around to coat it with marinade. Marinate the steak in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or ideally overnight.                          For the bruschetta: In a medium bowl, toss the tomatoes with the sesame oil, olive oil, vinegar, basil, sesame seeds and salt. Set aside.                          Remove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking; preheat a grill pan over high heat.                          Oil the grill pan with the vegetable oil. Season the steak on both sides with the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Grill over high heat until nicely marked and cooked to the desired doneness, about 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium. Allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before slicing on an angle, against the grain.                          Serve topped with the marinated tomatoes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"For the steak: In a large, resealable plastic bag, mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, chiles and ginger.","ingredients":[{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":221671,"name":"ziploc bags","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/plastic-bag.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the steak to the marinade, seal the bag, and move the steak around to coat it with marinade.
