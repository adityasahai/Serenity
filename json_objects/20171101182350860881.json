Process until they are very finely chopped and sticking together. With a spatula, transfer the cranberries to a small mixing bowl. Add the oats, hot fudge and 1 tablespoon of the cocoa powder. Using your hands or an electric mixer, mix until well combined.Place the remaining 2 teaspoons cocoa powder in a small shallow dish.Working quickly so the fudge doesn't melt, divide the mixture into 6 equal parts that are about 1 tablespoon each. Carefully form each into a ball.Roll each ball in the cocoa powder until evenly coated. When all the balls have been coated with the cocoa, place in a sieve and carefully bump the side of the sieve with the palm of your hand to shake off the excess cocoa powder, otherwise if there is too much cocoa powder the first bite will be bitter!Serve immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container lined with wax paper for up to 1 week.Note: If the mixture gets too soft/melted to roll, place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to chill and then proceed with forming the mixture into balls. The recipe says you can enjoy them immediately, but I liked them better after they chilled in the fridge for a while.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the dried cranberries in the bowl of a mini food processor fitted with a chopping blade.
