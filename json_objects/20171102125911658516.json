Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.Chop the top (pointy part) off of the garlic bulb so the cloves are exposed. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil into the bulb. Wrap the bulb in aluminum foil and place on the baking sheet. Brush the outsides of the jalapeno peppers with 1-2 teaspoon(s) of oil and set them on the baking sheet. Roast the garlic and jalapenos in the oven together for about 30 minutes, or until the skin on the jalapenos is charred and easily peeled and the garlic is soft and golden brown. Peel the skins off the jalapenos and slice them open to discard the seeds. Chop the peppers and set aside.In a large bowl, place the bricks of feta and shred them using a fork. Add the jalapenos, lemon juice and lemon zest. Squeeze the garlic right out of the bulb into the bowl. It will be soft and easy to squeeze/mash out. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of water and mash everything together with a fork. If you’d like your feta to be a little more “wet” for your spread, you can add more water to taste. Add salt & pepper to taste and mix in. Serve or store in the fridge for up to a week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400.
