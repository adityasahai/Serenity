Blanc are great choices for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the rice, coconut water, 1/2 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover; cook until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat; let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the butter and coconut; set aside.                          Meanwhile, combine the scallions, cilantro, thyme, garlic, habanero and 1/2 cup water in a food processor or blender; puree to make a smooth paste. Transfer 1 tablespoon to a small bowl; stir in the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, 1 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 cup water. Transfer the remaining paste to a large bowl and add the chicken and 1 teaspoon salt; toss to coat.                          Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the curry-scallion paste; cook, stirring, until the paste darkens and starts to separate, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through, 15 minutes.                          Increase the heat to medium high. Uncover and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 more minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups water, the carrots, chickpeas and spinach. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer until the chicken is tender, 15 more minutes.                          Transfer the chicken mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and top with the rice mixture. Bake until golden brown and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Top with golden raisins.
