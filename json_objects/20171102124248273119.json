medium low heat until they are soft and the onions are translucent.

Season with salt, chili powder, cumin and cayenne pepper. Stir and remove off of the heat to cool slightly.Into a large bowl add the remaining black beans. Smash the black beans until mostly smooth  and add in the cup and a half of cooked brown rice.Add in the cooled peppers and onion mixture, the third cup of bread crumbs and stir to combine. Add in the beaten egg and stir once more to combine.Form into 8 patties, forming them well so they hold together when cooking.Heat a griddle to 375 degrees or a skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat with more olive oil. Once hot, place the veggie patties {I worked in batches of four} and cook for 6-8 minutes a side. Flip {ever-so-carefully so you don't break the burgers} once a golden crust forms on the bottom and repeat for 6-8 more minutes.Serve on or off a bun with as many toppings as you desire.Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a 10-inch skillet add in the tablespoon of olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Sautee the onions and peppers over medium low heat until they are soft and the onions are translucent.","ingredients":[{"id":10111333,"name":"peppers","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/green-bell-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add in the minced fresh garlic and cook for one minute.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add in the 3/4 cup of thawed {or fresh} sweet corn kernels and the 1/4 cup of reserved black beans.
