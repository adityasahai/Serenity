A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Cook over medium heat, stirring periodically, for about 10 - 15 minutes, or until they are easily broken with a wooden spoon. Taste and add sugar to sweeten if needed. Stir sugar in and cook until dissolved.Pour the berry mixture into a powerful blender, such as a Blendtec, and puree until very smooth. I ran the \"whole juice\" pre-programmed functioin on my blender. After blended, cover and refrigerate the blackberry puree until cool, at least 30 minutes.While the blackberry mixture refrigerates, beat the cream cheese, milk, lime juice, zest (if using), vanilla, and sugar using a hand mixer or puree with a small food chopper until smooth. Set aside in the refrigerator until blackberry mixture has cooled.To assemble popsicles, layer the blackberry puree and cream cheese mixture in popsicle molds. Place popsicle sticks in the center and freeze until solid.If necessary, run hot water over the outside of the molds to assist in removing the pops before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the blackberries and water to a medium saucepan.
