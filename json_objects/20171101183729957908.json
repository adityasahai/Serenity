Coat molds of a mini-Bundt pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle with granulated sugar, shaking out excess.Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk together egg, brown sugar, apple butter, 1/3 cup maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil in another bowl. Add dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Divide half the batter among the prepared molds, spooning about 2 generous tablespoonfuls of batter into each mold.Bake until the tops spring back when touched lightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Loosen edges and turn the cakes out onto a rack to cool. Clean the mini-Bundt pan, then re-coat it with cooking spray and sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter.To make maple glaze: Combine confectioners sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Gradually whisk in enough maple syrup to make a coating consistency. Dip the shaped side (underside) of the doughnuts in the glaze to coat. Then set them, glazed-side up on a rack over wax paper for a few minutes until the glaze has set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make doughnuts: Preheat oven to 400F.
