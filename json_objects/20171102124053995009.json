Special equipment: Keawe wood              Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.                          Grind the Paniolo spice together with the coffee and salt (or the coffee with paprika, cumin, salt and pepper). Rub spice mixture over all the ribs. Place ribs in a heavy roasting pan and cook uncovered for 12 minutes, drain off excess fat.                          Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.                          Mix together water and Worcestershire sauce and pour around ribs. Cover pan tightly with foil and bake until tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Ribs may be prepared to this point a few days in advance.                          To prepare barbecue, light the Keawe wood and allow it to burn until coals are medium hot and spread out. Cook ribs 3 minutes on each side and dip or brush ribs in the sauce and cook slowly for another 5 to 6 minutes. Be careful not to burn the ribs.                          Warm a little Kona Coffee BBQ sauce to serve on the side. Serve with grilled corn and campfire potato salad or your favorite sides.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: Keawe wood","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":4,"step":"Grind the Paniolo spice together with the coffee and salt (or the coffee with paprika, cumin, salt and pepper).
