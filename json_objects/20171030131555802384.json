Firm plastic and polycarbonate molds are the best choices.Once you have invested in molds, they can be used over and over again. My best advice for extending the life of plastic or polycarbonate molds is to clean them with care. Wash them in hot, soapy water, carefully wiping them clean with a soft cloth (never any rough material or a scouring pad). Then rinse them well under running water and dry thoroughly, as water deposits can be as damaging to molds as scratchy scrubbers.Decorating With a Cornet:Prepare a cornet by cutting an 8-by-12-by-14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short side end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The top of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side so you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Then, just roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center and crease the fold. You will now have a cornet. When you fold a filled corner to close it, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening of the desired size at the tip of the cornet and fill the cornet with about 1/4 cup tempered chocolate. (You can also use the cornet for piping royal icing, buttercream, or any other firm icing.) Begin piping the chocolate onto the surface, making swags, dots, or any fine-lined design you like. Or, trace a pattern for, say, flowers or birds in dark chocolate and then fill the outline with milk chocolate or white chocolate. Piping fine decoration takes practice to achieve neat results. Draw a design on a piece of parchment paper with a felt-tip marker. Repeat the design a few times so you will have more than one example to practice on. Tape the paper in place to keep it from moving while you work. Turn the paper upside down (don't worry, the design is easily seen through the transparent parchment) so that the inked side is on the bottom, which will prevent the toxicity of the ink from affecting the chocolate. Fill the cornet with tempered chocolate and begin tracing the pattern in chocolate. When you feel you have had enough practice, you can immediately begin decorating your dessert. These test runs are not wasteful, as the chocolate can be scraped up and reused.", u'number': 1, u'ingredients': [{u'image': u'https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg', u'id': 14412, u'name': u'water'}]}, {u'equipment': [], u'step': u'From Jacques Torres\u2019 A Year in Chocolate: 80 Recipes for Holidays and Special Occasions by Jacques Torres, \xa92008 Stewart, Tabori, & Chang', u'number': 2, u'ingredients': []}], u'name': u'Tips'}], u'winePairing': {}, u'aggregateLikes': 91, u'instructions': u'Preparation                                                        Spray the interior of the egg molds with nonstick vegetable spray.
