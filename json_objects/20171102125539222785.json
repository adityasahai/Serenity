White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Add remaining ingredients except for cheese and sour cream. Sprinkle cheese over tortillas, leaving 1/2-inch border around edges, then arrange chicken and rice mixture down the center of each tortilla. (Optional: I like to dollop little bits of sour cream over the cheese before arranging chicken and rice mixture down the center – it makes the wraps delightfully creamy.) Roll stuffed tortillas, leaving edges open and slightly flatten the wraps with the palm of your hand. Spray seam-side of the wrap lightly with cooking spray.Heat a large non-stick skillet (or griddle) over medium heat for 1 minute. Arrange wraps, seam-side down, in pan or griddle and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side. Cooking them seam-side down first helps seal the long edge so they don’t fall apart. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining wraps. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix rice together with chili powder, cumin and garlic salt.","ingredients":[{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1062047,"name":"garlic salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-salt.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add remaining ingredients except for cheese and sour cream.
