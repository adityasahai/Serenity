Sparkling rosé are great choices for Tacos. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Trombetta Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Shake well until meat is thoroughly and evenly coated. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add ribs and brown, without turning, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to a slow cooker. Add sliced onion and bay leaf to the pot.In a small bowl, combine tomato paste, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Pour the tomato mixture along with the beer over the ribs and onions. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours. An hour before the ribs are done cooking, prepare cabbage. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet or cast iron over medium heat. Add cabbage and sauté 3-5 minutes. Turn heat up to medium high, add beer and simmer 15-20 minutes until beer is evaporated and cabbage is soft and starting to brown.To serve tacos, shred short ribs (they should fall apart!) and place desired amount in tortilla. Top with some braised cabbage and a dollop of sour cream. Garnish with chives or parsley if desired.
