I flip crepes by lifting corners with a fork. For filling, I combine all ingredients together with a mixer. The filling might be a little runny but no problem it will thicken up in fridge (if you store them) or while baking it will melt. Cover one side of crepe with filling; roll it up into a roll. Repeat until you are done.  Layer all crepes on ceramic baking sheet. Cover with condensed milk. Bake at 350 for at least 30 minutes. Serve them hot, sprinkling with some grated chocolate on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk eggs, sugar and flour until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add milk as you are stirring, followed by oil.Preheat frying pan until its sizzling hot, keeping heat at medium/high.
