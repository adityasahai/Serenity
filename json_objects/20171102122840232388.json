A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Special equipment: a 6-cup Bundt pan              For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 6-cup Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray.                          Beat the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Pour the coffee over the top and beat until the butter is fully melted. Add the eggs one at a time, then continue to beat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is very smooth.                          Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and beat in the flour, cocoa powder, salt, sour cream and almond extract until just combined. Pour into the Bundt pan and bake until a cake tester inserted center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a baking rack, about 30 minutes, and then invert onto the rack and turn right-side up. Put the rack over a baking sheet.                          For the glaze: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the chocolate, confectioners sugar and stout until the chocolate melts. Poke holes in the cooled cake with a toothpick, pour the warm glaze over and let set a few minutes before slicing. The cake will keep for 2 days at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: a 6-cup Bundt pan","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404748,"name":"kugelhopf pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bundt-cake-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
