Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Press this mixture into the prepared cake pan, evenly and firm.In the processor (give it a quick wipe!), add all the torte ingredients except the agave, salt, and strawberries. Process until super smooth. Add honey and salt to taste. Adjust sweetness if necessary. Pour this mixture on top of the prepared crust and smooth out.Carefully place the torte in the freezer (uncovered is fine) for several hours until firm. Freeze for 3 hours or more. When it’s ready and firm enough, place on the counter for about 10 minutes to soften up a bit.
