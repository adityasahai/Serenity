Heat 2 tablespoons of the chicken fat or oil in a saute pan and gently cook the onions until soft and caramelized. Let them cook at medium heat for a few minutes, then sprinkle a little salt and a little sugar over them. Cover the pan and turn the heat to low. Stir occasionally. This should take 15-20 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel.2 Beat the eggs with a little salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Soften the matzo a little by running them under cold water for a minute or so. The longer you wet them down, the softer they will be; it's your choice. Break the matzo up into pieces of about 1/2 to 1 inch into the bowl with the eggs. Stir in the caramelized onions and mix well. 3 Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of chicken fat in the saute pan over medium-high heat. Let this heat up for a minute or two, then pour in the matzo-egg mixture. Cook this, moving it around constantly, until the eggs are just barely set — you want them to be a little bit runny. This should take about 90 seconds or so. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley or chives.Sweet Matzo Brei1 Beat the eggs, 2 tablespoons milk, the salt, sugar and orange flower water (if using) in a large bowl. 2 In another bowl, crush the matzo into 1/2 to 1inch pieces. Add the cup of milk and mix well. Let this stand at least 30 seconds — the longer the matzo sits in the milk, the softer it will become. I like to let it stand 2 minutes. When you're ready, move the soaked matzo from the milk bowl into the bowl with the eggs. Mix well to combine.3 Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Let it heat up for a minute or two before adding the matzo-egg mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until the eggs are just barely set, about 90 seconds. Serve garnished with cinnamon sugar, apple sauce or something else sweet; jams and preserves are a good choice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Savory Matzo Brei1 For the savory matzo brei, you will need to caramelize the onions first.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":10018217,"name":"matzo","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/crackers.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat 2 tablespoons of the chicken fat or oil in a saute pan and gently cook the onions until soft and caramelized.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Let them cook at medium heat for a few minutes, then sprinkle a little salt and a little sugar over them.
