Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"With the help of a spiralizer, turn your zucchinis into noodles and set them aside in a large mixing bowl. Melt a little bit of cooking fat in a medium skillet set over medium-high heat and add the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and saute until cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Add the endive and asparagus and continue cooking until the veggies become tender, about 3-4 minutes While the chicken and vegetables are cooking, add all the ingredients for the avocado sauce to your small food processor and process until smooth and creamy. Add chicken and vegetables to reserved zucchinis and mix well. The heat from this alone will be enough to \"cook\" the zucchinis and make them nice and soft. Stir in avocado sauce, followed by chopped walnuts and fresh parsley. Toss to combine and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"With the help of a spiralizer, turn your zucchinis into noodles and set them aside in a large mixing bowl.
