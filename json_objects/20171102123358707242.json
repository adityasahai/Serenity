While the pasta cooks, toast the pine nuts over medium heat until fragrant.  Set aside.  Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet.  Add the garlic and stir constantly until fragrant and golden brown.  Remove the garlic from the pan, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.  Add the sprouts in a single layer, cut side down and cook for about 4 minutes, until the cut sides begin to brown.  Add salt, pepper and thyme and toss.  Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the sprouts are tender and browned evenly.  Add the wine and stir.  Allow the wine to reduce a bit, add the remaining olive oil, parmesan cheese, reserved garlic, pine nuts and cooked pasta.  Stir to coat well.Serve with more Parmesan cheese for garnish.Cassie’s Notes:If you don’t like Brussels Sprouts, then try them again!  Just kidding – you can sub broccoli, cauliflower or asparagus for the sprouts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the pasta in salted water according to the package directions.
