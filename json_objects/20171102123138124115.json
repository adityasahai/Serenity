Add the chopped garlic and onion to the food processor and also process until finely minced. Add the oil to a sauté pan on medium high heat and add the garlic and onion and cook for about 1 minute or just until fragrant, stirring so they don't burn. Add the Thai chiles and the tomato sauce, bring to a simmer, then lower the heat. Add the fish sauce, rice vinegar and sugar and mix well. Cook for about 5 minutes then remove from the heat and let cool completely. Transfer the sauce to a blender and blend until the sauce is smooth and the pepper seeds and skins have been completely incorporated. Taste the sauce and add more sugar, fish sauce or vinegar to taste. If the sauce seems extra thick add a teaspoon or two of water to loosen it. Blend again then pour into a sterilized jar or container. Refrigerate for up to 1 month.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the chopped Thai chiles to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a regular blade and process for a few seconds until they are finely minced, then scrape into a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":11670,"name":"thai chili","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thai-chiles.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chopped garlic and onion to the food processor and also process until finely minced.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the oil to a sauté pan on medium high heat and add the garlic and onion and cook for about 1 minute or just until fragrant, stirring so they don't burn.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the Thai chiles and the tomato sauce, bring to a simmer, then lower the heat.","ingredients":[{"id":11549,"name":"tomato sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg"},{"id":11670,"name":"thai chili","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thai-chiles.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the fish sauce, rice vinegar and sugar and mix well.
