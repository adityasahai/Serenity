bring to a low boil. Reduce to a simmer and allow to cook for 15 minutes then set aside to cool.Meanwhile preheat the waffle maker and then combine all of the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl (brown rice flour to salt) and sift together.In a separate large bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients (egg to honey) and add the coconut oil last. Make sure the coconut oil isnt hot before adding otherwise it will cook the egg.Using a spatula, fold the wet ingredients into the dry until they are just combined. Grease your waffle maker (if necessary) and then add the recommended amount of batter and cook as directed.While the waffles are cooking, place the 1/2 of the cranberries and maple syrup in a food processor and blend until smooth. You can blend more or less depending on how many chunks of cranberries you want in your syrup. Add the pureed syrup back to the remaining cranberries in the pot and stir together, then transfer it to a container for pouring.Serve waffles warm with cranberry syrup and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the cranberries and the maple syrup in a medium sized saucepan and bring to a low boil.
