Add the onion and cook until beginning to show color, about 8 minutes. Let cool completely.                          Combine the creamed corn, cornmeal, flour, milk, baking powder, salt, sugar and sauteed onion in a large container. Cover and let sit overnight.                          For the honey datil sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, sriracha, pepper sauce and honey in a large bowl and mix well. Refrigerate until ready to serve, preferably at least a few hours.                          For the fresh horseradish aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, relish, fresh horseradish root, pepper sauce and lemon juice in a large bowl and mix well. Refrigerate until ready to serve, preferably at least a few hours.                          Make the hushpuppies: Dice the alligator, duck bacon and ham into small uniform pieces (about 1/4 inch). Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the duck bacon and begin to cook.                          When the bacon is about half cooked, about 4 minutes, add the alligator and stir to combine. Cook the alligator through, about 5 minutes, then add the country ham and cook over medium or medium-low until the ham is heated through, being careful not to overcook the bacon. Turn off the heat, remove the meat from the pan and let cool to room temperature. Add the meat to the cornmeal batter and mix to combine.                          Heat 3 to 4 inches of the vegetable oil in a deep-fry pan to 320 degrees F.                          Spoon 2-ounce balls of batter into the oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and let cool slightly before serving with the honey datil sauce and fresh horseradish aioli.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometer","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-thermometer.jpg"}]}]},{"name":"For the fresh horseradish aioli","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, relish, fresh horseradish root, pepper sauce and lemon juice in a large bowl and mix well.
