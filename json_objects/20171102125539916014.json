Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate.

Boil the pasta until al dente. Just before draining, remove 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta.Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter. Add the chicken and season with salt + pepper. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 5-8 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.To the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil and butter. Add the cherry tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook the tomatoes without stirring for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes toss the tomatoes and cook another minute more or until the tomatoes are blistered. Add 2 cloves garlic and cook another 30 seconds being careful not to burn the garlic. Remove the tomatoes from the skillet to a plate.Set the skillet back over medium heat and add the remaining 2 cloves garlic, cook 30 seconds, then deglaze the pan with wine. Allow the wine to cook until it has reduced by half. Stir in the milk and parmesan, season with salt and pepper.Once the pasta is cooked, added it to the sauce along with the spinach. Cooking until the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir back in the chicken and tomatoes. Cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. If needed, thin the sauce with the reserved pasta cooking water. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil, lemon zest and mozzarella.Divide the pasta among bowls or plates and top each plate with bread crumbs, crushed red pepper and fresh basil. EAT!!Herb Butter BreadcrumbsPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Place the prosciutto slices on the baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until crisp. Remove and allow to cool. Once cool, finely chop the prosciutto. To the baking sheet, add the bread, butter and pistachios, tossing well to evenly coat. Place back in the oven and toast the mixture for about 5 minutes or until the bread crumbs are golden. If the bread crumbs seem as though they need more butter, add another 2 tablespoons.
