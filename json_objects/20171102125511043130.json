They take long. So dice them up. Place a large skillet over medium heat, add your fat of choice, add your minced garlic clove, then toss in your veggies. Use a spatula to move them around and heat all sides.Now it’s time to rice your cauliflower. Place your shredding attachment on your food processor and shred your chopped cauliflower on down. If you don’t have a food processor, you can also use a cheese grater and just grate/rice your cauliflower on that. It builds forearm strength anyways.Place a medium saucepan over medium heat and add your 2 tablespoons fat of choice to the saucepan.Toss in your minced garlic clove then once the garlic becomes fragrant, add in your riced cauliflower. Toss to help coat them cauliflower and not burn.Give your cauliflower about 2-3 minutes to begin to cook down then add your cup of vegetable broth.Let the vegetable broth cook off, about 6-8 minutes. Then add your tomato paste, hot sauce, garlic and onion powder, and salt and pepper. Mix well and set under medium heat to cook down.While your cauliflower grits are cooking down, mix your veggies around, then add your garlic powder, dried parsley, and salt and pepper. Add a splash of water to the pan then cover to let steam.Once veggies are almost done cooking, add your diced ham to mix around with all those flavors.Lastly, add a small skillet to the stove top and cook some eggs up however you like. I made my eggs over easy, because it’s just so easy!! I’m funny.Place grits down, then toppings, then some eggs. Mash it all together. And eat!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Let’s get the veggies going. They take long.
