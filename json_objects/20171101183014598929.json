Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese.

Trust me it makes a difference, but measuring will work ok if needed. Stir flour, yeast and sugar together. Then stir in salt. (salt kills yeast, so you shouldn't let it touch directly) Stir in water. Stir JUST until all flour is absorbed. NO KNEADING.  Cover dough in olive oil or canola oil. Let rise 30 -60 minutes. You can cover in saran wrap in the fridge and then let rest on the counter for 20 minutes if needed. In a stainless steel pan over medium heat, add the butter and oil then the onions and peppers. It will be a full pan, but don't worry. Stir everything together and then allow to start cooking. If it's browning the edges too fast turn down your heat. Allow to cook for 40-60 minutes, stirring every 5-10 minutes. Keep turning down the heat if the onions are browning too quickly. You'll want to scrape up the bottom and remember, brown is good as we want it to caramelize but turning brown in the first few minutes is too fast. Slow and steady for these guys. Place a pizza stone in the oven and heat to 475 degrees. Once the oven is hot, sprinkle a little cornmeal on the counter and stretch (do not roll with a rolling pin) the dough into 2 pizzas. Pull out your pizza pan and brush with a small amount of oil and a little sprinkling of cornmeal. Moving quickly, put the stretched out dough on the pan, spread a little sauce, sprinkle with cheese then add the pepperoni, sausage, peppers and onions. Bake for until the cheese and crust are beginning to brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with sun dried tomatoes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The key to a good dough is weighing your ingredients.
