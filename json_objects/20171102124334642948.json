In a heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Sear the steaks in the hot oil for 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer the steaks to a serving plate, tent with foil, and let stand.                          Using the same skillet, saute the shallots for 1 minute. Add the red wine, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Let wine boil until reduced by half. Add broth and blackberry preserves, return to a boil and reduce by half. (The sauce should coat the back of a spoon.) Whisk in the 2 tablespoons butter. Season sauce with additional salt and pepper, to taste.                          To serve, drizzle the sauce over the steaks. Place a pat of compound butter and scatter a few blackberries on the plate.                          In a bowl, combine butter and blackberries and mix well.                          Place on plastic wrap to mold into a log shape. Wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper.
