Pour the 1 ounce of whiskey into the melted butter and then pour the whiskey butter over the bread cubes. Toss to evenly coat and then dump the buttery bread cubes into an ungreased 9\" pie plate or about 6 (3 ounce) oven-safe ramekins. The dishes will be full of bread cubes.Add the heavy cream, Lucky Leaf Premium Blueberry Pie Filling, milk, sugar, eggs + egg yolk, cinnamon and salt to the large bowl and stir until the eggs are lightly beaten and everything is combined. Pour the liquid evenly over the bread cubes.Bake for 35-40 minutes. A knife inserted into the center will come out clean when it's done and the bread will be golden and toasty.While the bread pudding bakes, melt the  cup of butter for the whiskey sauce in a small saucepan over LOW heat. Add the water and sugar and stir. You want this liquid to be just barely warm -- the temperature is important because you don't want to scramble the egg. Add the egg and keep the heat low, STIRRING CONSTANTLY. You will gradually bring the heat up, stirring all the while. This tempers the egg and cooks it slowly. It will take 5-7 minutes to bring the heat up to medium, still stirring. The edges of the liquid will start to simmer and bubble. Stir one more time and remove it from the heat.Stir in the kosher salt, vanilla, and whiskey. Let the sauce sit for about 10 minutes so it will thicken before serving.Serve the bread pudding warm topped with whipped cream and the whiskey butter sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the bread cubes in a large bowl.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour the 1 ounce of whiskey into the melted butter and then pour the whiskey butter over the bread cubes.
