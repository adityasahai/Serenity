mushrooms, onions and garlic in the coconut oil over low to medium-low heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are completely wilted and have released their water into the pot. Then stir in the vinegar, cloves, rosemary, coconut aminos, and the arrowroot and stevia if you are using those last two. If using the arrowroot (or flour, or cornstarch), be sure to stir it in slowly, a little at a time, stirring constantly to quickly break up any lumps that may form otherwise. Allow this to simmer together for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then pour in the beef bone broth. Simmer over low heat for approximately 5 to 10 minutes to give the herbs a chance to impart their flavor on the broth. Cool slightly and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with some crusty garlic bread.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium to large soup or sauce pot, saute the mushrooms, onions and garlic in the coconut oil over low to medium-low heat.
