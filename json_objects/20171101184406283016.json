Stir until the honey is dissolved into the fruit and the thyme leaves are distributed throughout the fruit.Scrape fruit into a low wide pan, like a skillet or braiser. Place over high heat and cook, stirring very regularly, until the fruit is bubbling madly and has thickened a bit.

Funnel the jam into the prepared jars.Wipe rims, apply lids and rings, and process in a boiling water bath canner for 10 minutes.When time is up, remove jars and place them on a folded kitchen towel to cool. When they are cool enough to handle, remove rings and test seals. If seals are good, wash off any sticky residue from the jars and store them in a cool, dark place.For best flavor and texture, eat your apricot preserves within a year of making them.If any of your jars didn’t seal, place them in the fridge and eat promptly.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a small boiling water bath canner and three half pint jars.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the lids in a small saucepan and bring to a very low simmer.Wash the apricots.","ingredients":[{"id":9021,"name":"apricot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apricot.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Cut in half, remove pits and roughly chop.When all apricots are chopped, gather them into a bowl and add the honey and thyme leaves.
