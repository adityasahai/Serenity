Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Add the vanilla and peanut butter, and mix until incorporated.Add half the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, and mix for 15 seconds.  Add the rest of the flour, and mix just until the flour disappears.  Cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 3 hours (this is necessary so the cookies don't spread flat in the oven).Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Use a disher to portion out mounds of cookie dough about 2 inches apart, and bake for 10 minutes until golden brown.  Let the peanut butter cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets until they have set enough to move them to a wire rack.
