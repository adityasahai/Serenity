Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":442701,"title":"Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico","description":"Ruby red with garnet hues. The wine expresses a distinctive Tuscan bouquet of violet, cherry, and plum, with aromas of chocolate and spice. Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, cherry, and ripe plum with intriguing notes of cinnamon and clove. Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. It’s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011/166890"}]},"instructions":"In a food processor, combine all ingredients (potato flakes, flour, water, eggs, melted butter, salt, oregano and black pepper). Mix at low speed until dough forms. Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces and place 1 piece on a lightly floured work surface. Roll piece into a long rope, about 1/2-inch in diameter, flouring lightly if needed. Slice the rope into pieces 1/2-inch wide. Holding one piece at a time, roll the tines of a fork against the dough until slight indentations are formed. Repeat with each piece of dough, setting formed gnocchi on a floured kitchen towel or baking sheet.At this point, you may refrigerate the uncooked gnocchi for up to 2 hours or freeze them on the baking sheet and then transfer them into a covered container and store in the freezer for several weeks.Bring a large stock pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt, and cook the gnocchi until they float to the top. With a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi and spread on a baking sheet while brown-butter sauce finishes cooking. While the gnocchi are cooking, heat the butter in a deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once butter is melted, let sit undisturbed until the outside edges have begun to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Quickly swirl the skillet and add shallot and sage. Let cook for 1 minute longer, season with salt and pepper to taste and add gnocchi to skillet to toss with sauce and rewarm if necessary. Sprinkle with asiago cheese and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a food processor, combine all ingredients (potato flakes, flour, water, eggs, melted butter, salt, oregano and black pepper).","ingredients":[{"id":11378,"name":"instant potatoes flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-potatoes.png"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix at low speed until dough forms.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces and place 1 piece on a lightly floured work surface.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Roll piece into a long rope, about 1/2-inch in diameter, flouring lightly if needed.
