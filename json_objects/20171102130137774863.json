Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Toss to combine and set aside.Add the flour to a shallow dish. In another shallow dish add the eggs. In a third shallow dish combine the panko and cheese. Pat the chicken dry. Working with one piece at a time, dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, then dip in the eggs and then press into the panko mixture (on both sides).Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. When hot, place two of the prepared chicken breasts in the skillet. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side (depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts), until golden brown and the inside is no longer pink. Transfer the breasts to a paper towel lined plate. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the skillet and repeat with the final two chicken breasts.To serve, spoon some of the tomato salad over each chicken breast.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, add the cherry tomatoes, garlic, basil, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.
