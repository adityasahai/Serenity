whiskey. Set aside for 1 hour.In a medium saucepan or pot, combine the rice, water, milk, cream, butter, and salt. Bring it to a gentle boil, then cover the pot, reduce it to low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring twice during this stage. Note: The rice should be cooked, but there should still be visible creamy liquid; it should not all be absorbed. If the liquid looks like it is absorbing more quickly than this, you can cut this stage to 18-20 minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and add the sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Return to low heat for 5 minutes to finish cooking. Remove the pot from the stove and slowly drizzle in the beaten egg, stirring constantly. Drain the raisins and stir them in. If you'd like the pudding to be a little creamier, stir in a little more sweetened condensed milk. If it's too creamy, return to the stovetop and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately in a small bowl. ***While the rice is cooking for the first stage, make the Caramel-Pecan Sauce: Combine 1/2 cup butter, brown sugar, light corn syrup, and chopped pecans. Heat up the mixture over medium-low heat, then allow to bubbly gently for 5 minutes, or until consistency is like a nice caramel sauce.. Remove from the heat and set aside. Top each portion of rice pudding with some of the Caramel-Pecan Sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"***Be sure to use medium-grain rice (not long-grain.)***Use a nonstick saucepan if you have one.In a small bowl, combine the raisins and whiskey.
