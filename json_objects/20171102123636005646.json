White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try NV Mindbender Chardonnay.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color.

The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Cut the chicken into flat bite size slices that are ¼ inch thick and two inches square – being sure to cut against the grain of the meat. (This gives it extra tenderness.)Combine egg white, 1 tablespoon corn starch, 2 teaspoons sherry (or rice wine) and ¼ teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Stir until the cornstarch is completely dissolved. Add in 1 tablespoon of the canola oil and stir to combine. Add the chicken pieces and mix so the chicken is completely coated.  Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.In a small bowl, mix the chicken stock, soy sauce, white pepper, cornstarch and sherry or rice wine.  Set aside.Bring the water to a boil and add in 1 tablespoon of canola oil.  Remove from the heat and place chicken pieces in the hot water. With a spoon, separate the chicken pieces and quickly cover the pot.  Let the chicken sit in the hot water for two minutes until it is partially cooked but not cooked through.  Remove chicken to a platter and reserve. Discard the marinade and water.In a hot wok, heat to very hot.  Add in 1 tablespoon of peanut oil.  Stir-fry mushrooms for about 2 minutes or until tender.  Remove from the wok and set aside.  (Cooking the mushrooms separate is necessary because most home stoves can’t get a wok hot enough to cook all the vegetables at once.)When the wok is back to hot, add in the next 1 tablespoon of peanut oil, the white part of the chopped scallions, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes, and stir about 10 seconds.Add bok choy and ¼ teaspoon salt.  Stir fry until the bok choy is almost tender, about three minutes.  Add in the cooked mushrooms and snow peas and stir-fry an additional minute.  Add in cooked chicken and chicken stock mixture.  Heat just until chicken is cooked through and sauce has thickened. (about 30 to 60 seconds).  Serve stir-fry over rice and top with remaining chopped scallion tops.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the chicken into flat bite size slices that are ¼ inch thick and two inches square – being sure to cut against the grain of the meat.
