Season to taste with salt (I used about 3/4 tablespoon). Simmer until they are tender, another 7-10 minutes. In the meantime, bring a small pot of water to boil and poach the eggs until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny; toast the baguette rounds in a toaster or under a broiler. Serve the soup with the bread rounds resting on top to hold the egg, and drizzle with olive oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a heavy soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat, then add the celery, onion, and leek.
