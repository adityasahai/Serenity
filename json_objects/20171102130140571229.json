The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. The Dry Creek Vineyard Dry Chenin Blanc, Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430261,"title":"Dry Creek Vineyard Dry Chenin Blanc, Wine","description":"This beautiful wine is wonderfully consistent vintage after vintage. We receive superior Chenin Blanc fruit from the Wilson Ranch in Clarksburg, allowing us to produce an expressive, nuanced and delicious wine. At first swirl, aromatics of white pear, pineapple and banana spring forward from the glass. On the palate, the wine is refreshing with flavors of ripe tangerine and peaches. The mouthfeel is lively, but rich and has a subtle creaminess. 100% stainless steel fermentation guarantees the fresh fruit character fans of this wine have come to appreciate over the years. This is the quintessential summer sipper and the perfect wine to pair with fresh oysters!","price":"$15.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430261-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Dry-Creek-Vineyard-Chenin-Clarksburg/dp/B01N30XOBY"}]},"instructions":"Rinse the tomatoes.
