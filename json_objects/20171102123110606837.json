Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"1 Preheatoven, prepare roasting pan: Preheat the oven to 425F with a rack on the upper third of the oven.

Set aside half of the marinade to be used as a sauce (about 1/4 cup). 3 Toss wings with marinade, place on pan: Place the chicken wings in a bowl and toss with the remaining marinade. Arrange the wings, skin-side down, on the foil lined roasting pan, taking care not to crowd the pan.4 Roast in oven: Roast for 15 minutes, then remove from oven, use tongs to turn the wings over so that they are now skin-side up, and roast for another 10 minutes, until nicely browned. Check while roasting to make sure they aren't getting too dark. If so, place on a lower rack or cover with foil to finish cooking. 5 Toss with reserved marinade sauce: Place cooked wings in a bowl and toss with the reserved marinade sauce.6 Garnish: Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Place the chicken wings in a bowl and toss with the remaining marinade.
