Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442701,"title":"Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico","description":"Ruby red with garnet hues. The wine expresses a distinctive Tuscan bouquet of violet, cherry, and plum, with aromas of chocolate and spice. Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, cherry, and ripe plum with intriguing notes of cinnamon and clove. Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. Itâ€™s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011/166890"}]},"instructions":"Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
