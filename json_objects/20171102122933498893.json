Try pairing with Malbec, Pinot Noir, and Sangiovese. Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. The Catenan Alta Malbec with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 68 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":433317,"title":"Catena Alta Malbec","description":"Catena Alta Malbec is deep violet in color with indigo highlights. The nose has aromas of ripe red and black berry fruits with notes of violets and lavender and hints of leather and a touch of spices. The wine is full-bodied and rich, with sweet tannins and a smooth structure, offering multiple layers of blackberries and black currant with hints of licorice, vanilla, and black pepper. This wine's lengthy finish shows beautiful minerality with fine tannins and lively acidity.This Malbec would be absolutely wonderful with a variety of grilled meats but especially with more full-flavored dishes like barbecued leg of lamb or roasted baby goat.","price":"$67.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433317-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/catena-alta-malbec-2012/146121"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients.
