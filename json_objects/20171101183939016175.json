Timing may vary depending on stove, but mine needed 2 more minutes on each side. (You first waffle will like still be pale yellow and may have cooked unevenly. Like the first pancake, this is your throwaway one. The ones after should look light brown when they are finished.)Remove the side of the pan the finished egg waffle is clinging to, and hold it above a plate with the waffle upside down,. Using a chopstick or spoon, gently loosen it from the pan, starting on the top edge, using gravity to help it release. It will start to curl as it falls off and you should be able to get it out in one piece (except for the first waffle).Repeat with the remaining batter (re-greasing pans first) and then serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl,add all ingredients and mix with a whisk until only very small lumps remain.
