Set aside.Prepare the burgers. Place the onions and olive oil in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until they're golden and caramelly, 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for one minute, and then remove the onions and peppers to a large bowl.Return the skillet to the heat and add the red peppers. Cook until they are soft, about 4 minutes, and then add them to the bowl. Turn off the burner.Dump in the shredded carrots, the jalapenos (optional depending on your spice preference), and the chopped cilantro. Stir.Then mix in the spicy BBQ sauce, the honey, the kosher salt, the chili powder, and the paprika.Add the black eyed peas and smash them with the back of a fork until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated (you could also use a food processor for this). Cut in the wheat flour, adding more to reach your desired consistency (you want to be able to form patties out of the mixture, but you don't want them to be cakey or dry).Form 6-8 patties out of the mixture, place them on a plate and refrigerate until you're ready to cook them.Whisk together the all purpose flour, the 1 teaspoons paprika, the  teaspoon salt, and the  teaspoon cayenne pepper. Dredge the buttermilk soaked onion slices in the flour mixture to coat them.Heat the oil. Fry the onion slices until golden brown and then set them aside on paper towels to drain. It only takes about a minute to cook each onion ring.Spray a large skillet with non-stick cooking spray. Cook the burger patties over medium-high heat to brown on each side. You just want them to be hot all the way through. Depending on your skillet they may look a little charred. It's cool.Top each burger with pepper jack cheese. Then add sliced jalapenos. Place each dressed patty on a bun, top with an onion ring and then salad greens and a dollop of BBQ sauce. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the onion slices and the buttermilk into a large bowl to soak.
