Add the chicken and toss well, making sure the curry mixture completely coats the chicken. Let this sit while you prep the zucchini.Brush the slices of zucchini with the remaining olive oil on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Preheat the grill to medium high.While the grill preheats make the mango fried rice, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss in the cashews and dry toast them for about 5 minutes, flipping occasionally. They should be slightly browned in some spots, but its okay if theyre unevenly browned, you dont have to be too precise about it. Transfer cashews to a large plate.Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the red pepper. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the red pepper is seared. Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes, and toss for 30 seconds or so, being careful not to burn. Remove the veggies from the pan and place on the plate with the cashews.Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the eggs and season with salt and pepper. Stir the eggs constantly and cook until almost set but still moist, then transfer egg to a bowl. Break the eggs up with a wooden spoon or spatula.Add 1 more tablespoon of oil to the pan and about half of the rice. Toss to coat, then add in the remaining rice, tossing once again. Cook for about 3 minutes, tossing often, until warmed through.Add the soy sauce, hot sauce and red curry paste, and toss. Cook for another 3 minutes, until the rice has browned sufficiently. Add the veggies back in and the cashews and mango. Cook just until mangos are heated through. Keep warm on the stove while you grill the chicken and zucchini.When ready to grill, place the chicken onto the skewers (or if you do not have skewers you can place the chicken in foil or cook on the stove).Grill the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, gently flipping 2-3 times until chicken is cooked through and has light char marks. While the chicken is grilling grill the zucchini for about 4 minutes on each side, or until tender. You may also use a grill pan to do this.Once done remove everything from grill. Then spread the softened goat cheese all the way down one side of the zucchini. Place once piece of chicken on one end of the zucchini, right on top of the goat cheese and then roll up and place seam side down on a platter. Repeat with the rest of the zucchini slices.Serve the warm rice in a bowl and top with 3 or 4 warm zucchini rolls. Garnish with cilantro and more cashews.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, thai red curry paste, curry powder, cayenne, garlic, ginger, salt and pepper in a medium bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":93605,"name":"thai red curry paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-paste.png"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":2015,"name":"curry powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/curry-powder.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chicken and toss well, making sure the curry mixture completely coats the chicken.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Let this sit while you prep the zucchini.","ingredients":[{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Brush the slices of zucchini with the remaining olive oil on both sides.
