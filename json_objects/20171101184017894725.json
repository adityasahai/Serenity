Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle). It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":449340,"title":"St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle)","description":"This is a complex wine that reflects the heat of the afternoon sun, the cool, windy evenings, and the rustic soils of the McMinnville hills while retaining the dark beauty of its intense, ripe fruit. It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate. Ample ripe tannins balance with its acidity.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449340-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/st-innocent-momtazi-hill-pinot-noir-375ml-half-bottle-2014/167614"}]},"instructions":"Heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook each side of the tortilla.
