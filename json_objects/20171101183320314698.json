Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Line large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium-high speed until well combined and fluffy. Since the butter is cold, you must use a higher-powered electric mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, then add in the vanilla and beat until combined. Add the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, beating on low speed until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. You can cover and refrigerate the dough at this point for up to 2 days. Let the dough sit at room temperature until soft enough to form into balls.Weigh out 4-ounce portions of dough (about 1/4 cup) and roll into an even ball. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing far apart. You may need to bake in batches if you have small or too few baking sheets. Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cookies are slightly browned at the edges. Bake longer for crispier, chewier cookies, bake less for ooey gooey cookies. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cookies are best the day they are baked but may be stored in an airtight container for 2 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375°F.
