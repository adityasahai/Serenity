Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438039,"title":"Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"337 Cabernet Sauvignon exudes vibrant aromas of black cherry, ripe currant, fresh herbs and lightly roasted coffee. Smooth tannins and balanced acidity support core flavors of blackberry, black cherry and chocolate, intertwined with spicy black pepper accents on the finish. This wine can be enjoyed on its own or with herb-roasted pork loin, baked chicken or barbecued steak and sauteed mushrooms.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438039-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/noble-vines-337-lodi-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/165669"}]},"instructions":"Add all ingredients except for the cornstarch/flour to a slow cooker and give it a good stir to mix thoroughly.Cook for approximately 3 hours on high and 2 on low.
