White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is District 7 Estate Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Heat the garlic oil in a frying pan or Dutch oven that has a lid and in which the chicken breasts will fit pretty snugly. Add the scallions, stir, then sprinkle in the freeze-dried tarragon, stir again and cook them in the garlic oil for a minute, stirring some more as they cook.                          Put the chicken fillets into the pan, curved side down, and cook for 5 minutes, watching the scallions don't burn. If they look like they're beginning to, scrape them from the pan and let them sit on the chicken pieces.                          Turn over the breasts, and add the vermouth (or white wine). Let the vermouth bubble up, then add the salt. Put the lid on, turn the heat down low and leave it to simmer gently for 10 minutes. Check the chicken is cooked through by making a small cut into the thickest part and ensuring the juices run clear - if not, simmer for a few minutes longer and check again.                          Remove the chicken breasts to warmed plates. Bring the remaining liquid to a boil, add the cream and stir well, then sprinkle in the fresh tarragon, stir again and give a good grind of white pepper.                          Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts, and give a final scattering of tarragon to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the garlic oil in a frying pan or Dutch oven that has a lid and in which the chicken breasts will fit pretty snugly.","ingredients":[{"id":5062,"name":"chicken breast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg"},{"id":1004053,"name":"garlic oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/dutch-oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the scallions, stir, then sprinkle in the freeze-dried tarragon, stir again and cook them in the garlic oil for a minute, stirring some more as they cook.","ingredients":[{"id":1004053,"name":"garlic oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic-oil.jpg"},{"id":2041,"name":"tarragon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tarragon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the chicken fillets into the pan, curved side down, and cook for 5 minutes, watching the scallions don't burn.
