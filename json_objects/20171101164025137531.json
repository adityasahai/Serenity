Use half of remaining cinnamon and brown sugar to sprinkle on top of dough except for the top 1/2\" of one of the long sides. Add raisins and chopped pecans on top. Starting from the long side with toppings, roll to meet the long end without toppings. Use the plastic wrap to roll, pulling up on the ends and peeling it away. Lightly press the end of the dough into the log to secure roll.Using a sharp knife, cut slightly thicker than 1/4\" thick discs. Place 2\" apart on cookie sheets and bake for 9-11 minutes at 375 degrees or until lightly browning on edges.* Remove from oven and let cool on cooling racks. Repeat step for second ball of dough.To make drizzle, mix together powdered sugar, vanilla, 1 tablespoon of milk, and pinch of salt. Add more milk if needed for thinner consistency.
