A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Beat in  of the whipped cream, and then use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the remaining whipped cream  at a time. Fold in the almonds.Spoon the mixture into popsicle molds, making sure not to fill the molds over the fill line. The mixture is quite thick, so you will likely have to tap the mold several times to help the mixture settle to the bottom of the molds; take the time to do this though! You dont want big air bubbles because they could make it really difficult to unmold the popsicles. (My molds are 2 oz/75 ml and I got exactly 5 popsicles.) Tap the mold several times on a hard surface to help any air bubbles escape, then insert the sticks.Transfer to the freezer and freeze completely, about 3 to 4 hours, depending on the size of your popsicles and how cold your freezer is. To easily unmold the popsicles, dip the plastic bottoms in warm water and they should slide right out.Once unmolded, wrap each popsicle individually in plastic wrap and store in the freezer.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until its light golden brown and nutty smelling; cool slightly.Beat together the browned butter, cream cheese, stevia, vanilla, and cinnamon.
