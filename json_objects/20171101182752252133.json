The nose shows roasted herbs and meatiness with some background notes of sweet cherry, truffle and vegetal qualities. This is a distinctive Pinot Noir with aromatics that are very old-world. In the mouth the wine has always had a certain austerity but a bit of a gap in the middle. The wine has held up nicely over time but has never really developed the sweetness and charm that we would expect of our best Pinot Noirs.","price":"$55.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445451-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/beaux-freres-the-beaux-freres-vineyard-pinot-noir-1996/126352"}]},"instructions":"Place the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Allow to sit until softened and the yeast is bubbling, 2-5 minutes.  Stir in the remaining sugar, the taco seasoning and one cup of the flour and mix to combine.  Add in the salt, and start add in the flour, 1/4 to 1/2 cup at a time, until you have a dough that soft and tacky.  Knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.Place the vegetable oil in a large bowl.  Add the dough and turn to coat.  Place a towel or plastic wrap over the top and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.Make the filling while the dough is rising.  Combine the cream cheese and shredded cheddar cheese in a bowl.  Add in the jalapeos and stir until combined.Preheat the oven to 400F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  In a large pot, bring the 8 cups of water to a boil.  Add in the baking soda slowly. (It will bubble up, so make sure you add it in gradually and slowly.)Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.  Working with one piece at a time, roll it into a long rectangle, about 18-inches by 3-inches.  Cut the piece into 4 equal pieces.  Place about 2 teaspoons of the filling down the center of each piece.  Carefully roll the dough over the filling, then pinch in the ends and the seam.  Add the dough to the boiling water and let it boil for 30-60 seconds.  Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the baking sheet, spacing a couple inches apart.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.Lightly beat the egg with a splash of water.  Brush the egg over the tops of the pretzel sticks, then sprinkle with coarse salt.  Bake in the preheated oven until dark and brown, 15-18 minutes.To make the taco guacamole, mash the avocados in a large bowl.  Stir in the sour cream, taco seasoning, cilantro and lime juice.  Season to taste with salt.  Serve the guacamole with the warm pretzel sticks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer.
