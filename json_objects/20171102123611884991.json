White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay.

Mix well.Add in the cut up chicken and stir to coat. The mixture is very thick, and I found it much easier to use my hands to really rub the tomato paste mixture all over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours - overnight (the longer the better!)To grill:Preheat your grill to medium heat and lightly spray with cooking spray.Using sharp skewer sticks, alternate between pieces of chicken and onion, piercing each piece and sliding it to the end, building a \"stack\" of skewered ingredients as you go.Place the skewers on the grill and cook until no longer pink inside, rotating every so often to ensure even cooking. This takes about 10-15 minutes.While the chicken cooks, it's time to make the sauce.Place the grated cucumber into a kitchen towel and ring out the excess water.Add the cucumber, and all the other sauce ingredients, into a medium food processor and blend until smooth, well mixed, and the mint gets broken down.Garnish the skewers with fresh mint and serve with yogurt sauce.DEVOUR.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl combine the tomato paste, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, cumin powder, garlic, cinnamon and olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":1012028,"name":"smoked paprika","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"ground cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":11887,"name":"tomato paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix well.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add in the cut up chicken and stir to coat.
