Layer nectarines in concentric circles around the top of the cream cheese, covering the entire surface of the tart.Cover just the rim of the tart with foil to prevent the edges from burning. Slide tart into oven and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees, remove foil from edges, and continue baking for another 25 minutes. The filling should rise between the fruit and you will see it brown.Remove tart from oven and gently spread warmed jam over top with a pastry brush. Sprinkle with sliced almonds, if using. Slide back into the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.Cool completely before slicing. Serve with whipped cream on top of slice. If you’re not eating it that night, put plastic wrap over the cooled torte and let it sit in the fridge until you cut it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the crust: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
