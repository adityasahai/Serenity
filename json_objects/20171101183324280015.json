Since veggie burgers are usually lean, you'll want low to medium tannin wines. Pinot noir is a great choice. Another option is Spanish tempranillo, which pairs nicely with the earthy flavors you might have from beans, lentils, mushrooms, etc. One wine you could try is The Donum Estate Russian River Valley Pinot Noir. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 67 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":433784,"title":"The Donum Estate Russian River Valley Pinot Noir","description":"This Pinot Noir displays abundant and intense aromas of ripe black fruits, including cherry, plum and raspberry, in a complex and concentrated nose.
