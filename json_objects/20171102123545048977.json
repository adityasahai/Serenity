great choices for Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Double Canyon Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441790,"title":"Double Canyon Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"This Cabernet embodies an enticing array of ripe red and black plum, intermixed with notes of fresh red cherry. Characteristic of the appellation and 2014 vintage, the nose offers spiced potpourri with a touch of raspberry preserves. The addition of Syrah leads to a full and rich texture on the mid-palate, further accented by bright acidity from the Petit Verdot, sweet red fruit from the Merlot and luscious blackberry notes supplied by the Malbec. The soft and supple mouthfeel is supported by the complexity of sweet oak tannins and fresh fruit character, finishing with the juicy acidity that is characteristic of Horse Heaven Hills.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441790-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/double-canyon-horse-heaven-hills-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/160719"}]},"instructions":"1  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil on high heat in a large sauté pan.

Remove the peppers, onions, and garlic from the pan and set aside.2  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat.  Add the mushrooms and the turkey to the pan. Sear the mushrooms and turkey over high heat, stirring often, for 3-4 minutes, until the turkey and mushrooms begin to brown. Reduce the heat to medium, return  the peppers-and-onion mixture to the pan and mix well.3  Squeeze the tomatoes to break them up, and add them with their juices to the pan, along with the Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, rosemary and black pepper. Mix well, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and simmer for 15-20 minutes.4  Stir the cornstarch into the yogurt and add to stew.
