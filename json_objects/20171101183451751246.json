Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Mix all the ingredients except shrimps and scallions to make the marinade.Wash and thoroughly pat dry the shrimps. Marinate the shrimps in the prepared marinade for at least 30 minutes, for the flavor to develop properly. You can marinate this overnight if you want.When ready to cook, heat a non-stick pan and add 1 tsp of oil. Once the oil is well heated add the shrimps and stir-fry for 4-6 minutes. Keep stirring/tossing the shrimps while frying.Finally add the chopped scallions, give a last quick toss.Serve hot with lime wedges on side.If you want you can also grill these shrimps, just add them on skewers along with scallions, grill on each side for 2-3 minutes. Enjoy.Mix all the ingredients for the dressing except the sesame seeds, cover and keep refrigerated until ready to use.On a dry heated pan slightly toast the sesame seeds until they just start to change the color; about a minute or 2. Keep stirring the seeds to avoid them from burning. Once done remove the seeds from the pan immediately and keep aside.Prepare the vegetables.When ready to make, toss the vegetable into the dressing. Toss well. Sprinkle the toasted seeds on the salad and give a final quick toss. Serve immediately.Preheat your oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 9-inch square cake pan (I used 2 medium size loaf pan).Cream the butter and the sugar together. Whisk in the yogurt, rose water, egg yolks and lime zest. Stir in the flour, semolina and baking powder and mix well to incorporate. Mix the ground almonds.In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they are white, fluffy and just making soft peaks. Carefully fold these into the mixture so that they are well incorporated.Pour the batter into the pan and bake for about 45 minutes or until the cake is deep golden brown and cooked through. Let cool while making the syrup.To make the syrup, put the sugar, rose water and 1 cup of water in a small saucepan and boil for about 5 minutes. Pour the hot syrup over the cake and let it cool completely (2-3 hours).To serve, cut the cake in small pieces and serve with a not too sweet ice cream. { I enjoy this cake just by itself!!! }","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix all the ingredients except shrimps and scallions to make the marinade.Wash and thoroughly pat dry the shrimps.
