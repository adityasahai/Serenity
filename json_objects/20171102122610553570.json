oven to 375 F.In a large saucepan, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage together. Drain and set aside to cool.Over medium heat, saute the garlic and red pepper flakes in the olive oil just until soft. Add both cans of tomatoes, basil, oregano and fennel seeds. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not over cook and dry out the sauce. Remove from heat.To make the filling, in a large bowl mix the Ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, and salt together. Add in 2 cups of the Mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Mix the drained and cooled meat into the Ricotta cheese mixture. Add 1 cup of the cooled sauce.In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1 cup of Mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Set aside.Bring a pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile line work surface with a clean kitchen towel. Add 3-4 noodles to the water at a time. Using tongs, remove noodles after 30 SECONDS (just long enough to soften them and make them pliable) and lay them on the kitchen towel. Continue until all noodles are ready.Turn water off and carefully pour some of the boiled water into a bowl. Keep near your work surface to dip noodles in if they are not pliable enough to roll.Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce into a 139 baking dish.Spread a heaping 1/3 cup of filling mixture onto bottom 3/4 of each noodle, leaving top 1/4 of noodle uncovered. Starting from the end with cheese, roll into the noodle into a tube shape and arrange in baking dish seam side down.Top evenly with remaining sauce, covering each noodle completely.Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake on the middle rack until the sauce bubbles, about 40 minutes.Remove roll ups from the oven and adjust the oven rack to the highest position. It should be about 6 inches from the heating element. Sprinkle remaining Mozzarella and Parmesan mixture evenly over each individual roll up. Do not replace the foil. Broil until cheese starts to brown (watch carefully, only a minute or so!). Cool 15-20 minutes before serving to allow the roll ups to set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 F.In a large saucepan, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage together.","ingredients":[{"id":7036,"name":"italian sausage","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/italian-sausage.jpg"},{"id":10023572,"name":"ground beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fresh-ground-beef.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain and set aside to cool.Over medium heat, saute the garlic and red pepper flakes in the olive oil just until soft.","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add both cans of tomatoes, basil, oregano and fennel seeds.
