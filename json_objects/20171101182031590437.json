Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442701,"title":"Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico","description":"Ruby red with garnet hues. The wine expresses a distinctive Tuscan bouquet of violet, cherry, and plum, with aromas of chocolate and spice. Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, cherry, and ripe plum with intriguing notes of cinnamon and clove. Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. Itâ€™s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011/166890"}]},"instructions":"Into two glasses add the ice, frozen berries and cascade ice.
