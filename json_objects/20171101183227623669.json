Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Chateau Ste.

Remove three-fourths of shell of each shrimp, leaving the last section and tail intact. With small, sharp paring knife, cut shrimp along the vein underneath, but do not cut completely through. Both veins should now be exposed. Wash veins out of the shrimp. Repeat for all shrimp. Drain shrimp and refrigerate, covered.With kitchen shears or sharp knife, cut bacon in half all at once; set aside with red peppers, green peppers and onion wedges. Combine black pepper, cayenne and paprika; stir until well-blended; set aside. Whip softened butter with garlic and wine until well-combined. Set aside until needed. Wrap 1/2 piece bacon around each shrimp body (not tail).On each of 6 (12-inch) wooden or metal skewers, place, in order:1 green pepper piece1 slice beef1 red onion wedge1 chicken strip1 red bell pepper piece1 bacon-wrapped shrimp (skewer through main body)1 pineapple cubeanother bacon-wrapped shrimp1 red bell pepper piece1 chicken strip1 red onion wedge1 beef strip1 green pepper pieceDo not place vegetables, meat or shrimp too close together, or they will not cook evenly. Refrigerate skewers while preparing a medium fire (or low flame on gas grill with the lid open). A high flame will cause bacon grease to flare up and burn wooden skewers. Keep a small cup of water at hand to sprinkle over fire if this happens. Soak skewers of food in Italian dressing (or marinade) 2 to 3 minutes before starting to cook. Place on grill , sprinkle with pepper-paprika mixture and baste with reserved butter mixture (about 1/2 cup total). Slightly melt remaining butter and serve with mixed grill .Slice onions and bell peppers. Saute in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over low heat until onions are translusent yet not browned. Add sausage until heated.
