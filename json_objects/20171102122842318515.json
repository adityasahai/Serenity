Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

Add the spaghetti all at once and let the pot return to a boil. Give it a stir then reduce the heat just a little so that it stays at a boil but does not boil over. Cook according to package directions. Save a cup of the pasta water before you drain the pasta.Add the olive oil and the thinly sliced onion to a large skillet over medium high heat. Sauté for 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and starts to brown. Add the garlic and chili flakes and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the tomatoes to the pan and cook until a few of them start to burst, about 5-7 minutes.Add the smoked salmon, peas and artichoke hearts to the pot and warm them through. Remove the pan from the heat and stir through the parmesan cheese, lemon juice and lemon slices.Add the cooked pasta to the pot and toss to coat well. Add a splash of the reserved cooking liquid if it seems a little dry.Serve immediately with extra fresh grated parmesan cheese on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the spaghetti all at once and let the pot return to a boil.
