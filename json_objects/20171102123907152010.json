Love brown sugar.Cream the sugars and the margarine together.Add in your two eggs, as I am wont to do when they are all I have, I used one double yolker-huge egg instead of two small ones.Whisk together the dry ingredients.Add in the molasses to the margarine/sugar mix.Combine the wet and dry and mix well.Then add in your raisins.Divide the dough into two pieces, and from each half form three long rolls on a cookie sheet.Like this, build them up as high as you can and they fit across a baking sheet, width-wise. When you build them up, you get a thicker, chewier bar. Bake them in the oven at 375 for 13-15 minutes, and do not over/under bake. This from my grandma’s instructions.  So they need to be baked until the edges are cooked and the middle slighty still underdone.Slice them across into about 8-10 squares when they are fully cooled, needless to say, this recipe makes a large amount, you can end up with 40-60 of the little bars!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Kick the tires and light the fires to 375Sigh.
