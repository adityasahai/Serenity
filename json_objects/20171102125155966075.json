Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper.Start by brewing a nice, strong cup of coffee and set it aside to cool.Combine all the dry ingredients (sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt) in a large bowl and mix to combine. I like to sift in the cocoa powder, since it tends to be very lumpy. Mix them all together.Mix all the liquid ingredients (eggs, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla) in a large measuring cup.Pour in the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix to combine.Divide the cake batter evenly between the two cake pans.Bake for 30-35 minutes.Cool the cake layers. When they are cool enough to handle, slice each cake layer in half horizontally.Meanwhile, make the Strawberry Mousse. Combine the strawberries and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook just long enough for the berries to become soft, about 10-15 minutes. Cool slightly and puree in the food processor. You will most likely have strawberry puree left over. You only need  cup of strawberry puree. I used the remaining strawberry puree as a syrup for pancakes, crepes, waffles, etc. Set aside to cool.Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and set aside to bloom, for about 5 minutes. Heat the gelatin in a microwave for just 20-30 seconds, until the gelatin dissolves, but be careful not to boil it.In a chilled bowl and whisk attachment, whip up the chilled heavy cream until soft peaks form.Add the strawberry puree and mix to combine.Pour in the gelatin, mix to combine. Place the strawberry mousse in the refrigeratorMeanwhile start making the Frosting. Cream the softened butter and cream cheese in the large bowl of a standing mixer, using a paddle attachment, or a hand mixer, until creamy and fluffy.Add the powdered sugar, mix to combine. Sift in the cocoa powder and mix to combine.Divide the frosting in half. Set aside one half to be used to make the chocolate petal design on top of the cake later.Add the sour cream, condensed milk and vanilla to the other half of the frosting and mix to combine. Add as much condensed milk as you like, depending on how sweet you want the frosting to be.Place some aluminum foil all around your cake platter. Place a dollop of frosting on the bottom of the plate and place the first cake layer on top of it.Spread some of the frosting on top of the first cake layer. Sprinkle in some of the chopped strawberries on top of the frosting.Spread out the Strawberry Mousse on top of the second cake layer, followed by more of the chocolate frosting and strawberries on top of the third cake layer.Frost the top and sides of the cake with more chocolate frosting.Decorate the cake with a chocolate petals design on top and a chocolate cage around the sides. Remove the aluminum foil. I will have additional posts describing in details how to do both.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.Grease 2 (9 inch) round baking sheets with oil.
