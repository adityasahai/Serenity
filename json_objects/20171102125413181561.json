Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. One wine you could try is DeLille Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 70 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":457303,"title":"DeLille Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"This vintage has powerful yet harmonious fruit and oak balance. Classically structured with great lift, the 2013 Four Flags includes rich cassis, black cherries and pine nut nuances. Add savory ripe tannins, toasty oak, exotic spices of coriander and cardamom along with a smoky texture and you can see how complex and dynamic itis right now. Equally important, there are clues as to where this wine is headed as it develops over the next decade.","price":"$69.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/457303-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/delille-four-flags-cabernet-sauvignon-2013/176062"}]},"instructions":"In a large saute pan, heat canola oil over medium. Add minced onion and saute for about 8 minutes till softened. Add the garlic and green bell pepper. Continue to saute for another 5 minutes till garlic is fragrant and bell pepper is tender-crisp. Add the beef to the pan and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook for 5-6 more minutes, stirring twice, till meat is browned.Sprinkle paprika and caraway seeds evenly across the top of the meat. Add diced tomatoes to the pan. Pour 4-5 cups of hot water into the pan, till the meat is almost covered. Stir and bring to a boil.Reduce heat to a simmer and cover to pan. Let the mixture simmer slowly for about 90-100 minutes, replenishing the water as needed to keep it from getting dry. The stew is ready when the meat is fork tender and the sauce is thick. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste before serving, if desired.Serve over spaetzle, potatoes, rice or noodles. It would also be great over quinoa. Kosher for Ashkenazi Passover when served over a KFP starch (ex: potatoes). Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.
