Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. One wine you could try is Salentein Killka Malbec. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436136,"title":"Salentein Killka Malbec","description":"The color is ruby red with tints of violet. The aroma rich in fruit, reminiscent of plum, black fruits, blackberries and violets. The palate shows great structure and well-balanced acidity.
