After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB"}]},"instructions":"To prep steak, whisk together marinade ingredients (the coconut milk through the chili sauce) in a large bowl. Season the steak with salt and pepper then add to a large baking dish or ziplock bag. Pour marinade over top and refrigerate for 2-24 hours.To make the dressing, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. You can do this ahead of time or right before you make the steak if you choose to use the oven. Place chopped mango, chili powder and teaspoon of olive oil on a baking sheet and toss. Roast for 20 minutes until just golden and caramely. In the bowl of your food processor (or blender), add roasted mango, lime juice, vinegar and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Stream in olive oil with the processor going until the dressing comes together. This can be stored in the fridge for a few days.When you're ready to make the salads, cook the steak however you'd desire - I either grill it or broil it. To broil, I place the rack directly underneath the broiler. The steak is usually slightly less than 1 inch thick, so I broil about 5 minutes per side for medium to medium-well steak. Let it rest before slicing against the grain into strips.To assemble the salads, combine greens with mango, onions, cilantro and sprinkle of salt and pepper. Add steak and cashews over top, then drizzle on dressing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prep steak, whisk together marinade ingredients (the coconut milk through the chili sauce) in a large bowl.
