The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. You could try Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 450°F.Stretch and roll out your pizza dough on a floured work surface until as thin as possible without tearing.
