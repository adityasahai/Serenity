A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Line two standard size muffin pans with liners; set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat the cake mix and the butter until a thick dough forms. Add the yogurt and milk, mix until combined. Add the eggs and beat for 1 minute on medium speed.Scoop into the liners (3/4 of the way full) and bake for 18-20 minutes or until the tops spring back. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, crush the sandwich cookies (discarding any cream in the centers) and set aside. I do this in a plastic zip bag with my rolling pin, you can also use a food processor.In a microwave safe bowl (or over a double boiler), melt the coconut oil, then add the candy melts. Whisk until smooth. Remove from the heat and dip the strawberries in, swirling to remove excess chocolate. Set on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Fill a piping bag or plastic zip bag with the remaining melted chocolate and drizzle over the hardened strawberries.While the strawberries are setting, remove a quarter size hole in the center of the cupcakes, about -inch deep (you can also use a cupcake corer if you have one). Using an offset spatula or butter knife, frost around the hole, then sprinkle the cookie crumb \"dirt\" on top. Burry a strawberry \"carrot\" in the center of each cupcake. Garnish with little sprigs of mint for sprouts if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
