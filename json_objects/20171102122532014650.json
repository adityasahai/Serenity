Set off to the side. An air popper works great here!In a medium pot, combine the sugar, butter, maple and corn syrup. Bring to a slow boil for 5 minutes without stirring.Once the 5 minutes are up, remove the pan off of the heat and whisk in the baking soda, salt and vanilla.Carefully pour the caramel into the bag with the pop corn. Roll the top of the bag tightly, leaving room, and shake to coat the pop corn.Once coated, divide the caramel covered popcorn onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in your preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring the caramel corn every 20 minutes.Note: if you want to add peanuts into the mix; add half if the caramel to the popcorn in the bag and give it a good shake. Add in 1/2 cup (more or less) of peanuts or pecans and toss together before adding the remaining caramel.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 250 degrees and line two rimmed baking sheets with a silicone baking mats OR grease with butter.Work in batches of 2, pop the corn and place into a large paper bag.
