Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Mionetto Cuvee Sergio Prosecco.

These flavors and aromas have disappeared over the years but now Mionetto are reintroducing them in this excellent cuv\xe9e.A delicate pale yellow color, with a characteristic aroma that blends with hints of honey and crab apples. It is dry and pleasantly slightly bitter on the palate. Lean due to the right level of acidity, it is moderately full-bodied with a fine and intense perlage.A balanced, smooth and refreshing sparkling wine that is ideal for any occasion, thanks to its moderate alcohol content and versatility. It is best served with simple light fish or vegetable dishes.
