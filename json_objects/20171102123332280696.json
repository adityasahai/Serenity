In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare.

If it looks too thin, add a touch more flour. If it looks to thick, add more buttermilk.Pour evenly into 12 muffin tins and top each with a slice of jalape単o (optional), seeds removed.Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Remove from oven and let rest in the pan for a few minutes. Then transfer to a plate or bowl for serving. Cover to keep warm.I highly recommend serving these with just a touch of butter and honey.Will keep in an airtight container for up to a couple days.
