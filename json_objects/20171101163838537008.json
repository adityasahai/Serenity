Spread some of the cranberry sauce on half of each tortilla.  Top each with some of the turkey and a few apple slices.  Sprinkle with some of the cheese.  Fold the empty half of the tortilla over the filling to form a semicircle.  To make the dip - combine the greek yogurt, cranberry sauce, rosemary, garlic powder and salt in a small bowl.  Mix to combine and set aside.Set a skillet over medium high heat. When hot, spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.  Place an assembled quesadilla in the pan and cook, flipping once halfway through, until both sides are browned and the cheese is melted.  Repeat with all of the quesadillas.
