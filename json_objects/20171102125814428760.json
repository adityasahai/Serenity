dish"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{"pairedWines":[],"pairingText":"No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Start by making your meat balls. In a medium bowl, mix the meat, 1 tsp of each of the following ingredients: basil,garlic powder, onion powder, chilli flakes and oregano. Mix in the egg, 1/4 cup of parmesan and the bread crumbs.Once everything is well mixed in, In a large and deep skillet, heat up the oil and throw in the garlic, the onion , the zucchini, the mushrooms and the chopped prosciutto. Let it cook on medium heat for 3 minutes stirring frequently.Add in your meatballs and brown them ( about 3-4 minutes).  Stir frequently.Stir in the 2 cans of tomato sauce along with 1 tablespoon of basil, 1 tablespoon of oregano and 1/4 cup of parmesan. Let it simmer on medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently.*For those managing their blood sugar, Dreamfields Pasta should be cooked separately according to package directions. Set the cooked pasta aside and once the sauce is done, pour it on top of the cooked pasta.Add the pasta and 1/2 cup of water. Let the pasta cook, stirring frequently (about 20 minutes). If the pasta dish looks like it does not have enough liquid as the pasta cooks, add a bit more water. Once the pasta is al dente, stir in the cream cheese and the parmesan. Mix in well.
