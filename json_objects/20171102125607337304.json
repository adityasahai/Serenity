A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

The aromas are a complex mixture of licorice, blackberry, and a whisper of vanilla. The rich jammy taste has hints of licorice, herbs, spice and currants with a lingering finish of almond and anise. Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Ch√®vre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.                          Melt the chocolate, butter and oil in a medium bowl in the microwave until completely melted, about 1 minute. Whisk the mixture until smooth. Stir in the orange zest and cool slightly.                          Whisk the sugar, egg and yolk until pale in a medium bowl. Whisk in the melted chocolate mixture. Stir in the flour and vanilla until smooth. Divide the batter among four prepared muffin tins. Bake the cakes until just barely dry on top (they will be soft in the middle), about 12 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and cool, about 5 minutes.                          Gently flip the cakes onto a plate. Sprinkle the cakes with sea salt and top with the orange supremes. Drizzle with a bit of oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
