The Chenin Blanc gives the wines its fruit salad, guava and melon aromas and a refreshing acidity. Some sur lie on the less for a few months adds to the complexity and body. A touch of aromatic Viognier complements the fruit structure with some floral hints. The wine is perfect on its own as an aperitif on the porch on a hot summer's day. Chenin Blanc pairs well with a wide range of foods, especially sushi, oysters, Asian curries, sweet-and-sour dishes, and summer salads.Blend: 87% Chenin Blanc, 13% Viognier","price":"$8.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439943-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/essay-chenin-blanc-2014/139942"}]},"instructions":"Instructions","analyzedInstructions":[]}]}
