and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Place a wire cooling rack inside of a baking sheet.  On a plate, whisk together the egg and water.  On a second plate, place the almond flour.  Season both sides of each chicken breast with salt and pepper.  Dip the chicken in the egg mixture, then dredge the chicken in the almond flour until coated well.  Place breaded chicken onto prepared baking sheet with a cooling rack inside.  (This helps the heat rotate around the chicken, preventing the breading from getting soggy on the bottom.)  Repeat with each chicken breast.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the chicken reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature.Meanwhile, prepare dressing by whisking all the ingredients, but the poppyseeds.  Once smooth, lightly stir in the poppyseeds.  Keep refrigerated.Assemble salad by placing lettuce on a plate.  Sprinkle mandarin orange segments, strawberry slices, and butter toffee almonds over the lettuce.  Slice a warm chicken breast in thin slices, then place it on top of the salad.  Drizzle with dressing.
