Sprinkle gelatin over water. Let stand until gelatin softens and absorbs water, at least 15 minutes.Combine 2 cups sugar, corn syrup, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup cold water in heavy medium saucepan.Stir over medium/low heat until sugar dissolves, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush.Attach candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat and bring syrup to boil. Boil, without stirring, until syrup reaches 240°F, about 8 minutes.With mixer running at low speed, slowly pour hot syrup into gelatin mixture in thin stream down side of bowl (avoid pouring syrup onto whisk, as it may splash). Gradually increase speed to high and beat until mixture is very thick and stiff, about 15 minutes.Add vanilla and peppermint oil(5 drops will give you a strong mint flavor) and beat to blend, about 30 seconds longer.Scrape 1/2 the marshmallow mixture into prepared pan.Add the red coloring to the remaining marshmallow and whisk again, just until the color is mostly blended in(red streaks are ok).Pour the red marshmallow on top of the white marshmallow and swirl the colors together with a spoon or knife(work quickly, the marshmallow sets up fast!)Smooth top with wet spatula(I use my fingers, dipped in a little water). Let stand uncovered at room temperature until firm, about 4 hours.Stir cornstarch and powdered sugar in small bowl to blend. Sift generous dusting of starch-sugar mixture onto work surface, forming rectangle slightly larger than 13x9 inches.Turn marshmallow slab out onto starch-sugar mixture; peel off foil. Sift more starch-sugar mixture over marshmallow slab. Coat large sharp knife (or cookie cutters) with nonstick spray.Cut marshmallows into squares. I cut them into squares that are about 1 1/2\"x1 1/2\".Toss each in remaining starch-sugar mixture to coat. Transfer marshmallows to rack, shaking off excess mixture.Store the marshmallows in an air-tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line 13x9x2-inch or 8x8 inch metal baking pan with foil.Coat foil lightly with nonstick spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour 1/2 cup cold water into bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with whisk attachment.
