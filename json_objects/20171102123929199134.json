process until smooth. Transfer batter to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. (The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick, stir in 1/4 to 1/3 cup water.)To make apple compote: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter is a light brown, about 30 seconds. Add apple slices and sprinkle with 1/3 cup sugar. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the apples are tender and lightly caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon. Set aside.To cook and fill cr&amp;ecirc;pes: Heat an 8-inch seasoned cr&amp;ecirc;pe pan over medium-high heat until a drop of water dances on the surface. Using a paper towel, rub the pan with a little oil. Ladle about 3 tablespoons of the cr&amp;ecirc;pe batter into the pan and swirl to coat the bottom evenly. Cook until the underside is lightly browned, 30 to 45 seconds. Loosen the cr&amp;ecirc;pe with a spatula, and quickly turn over with your fingertips. Cook until the bottom is lightly browned, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, rubbing pan with more oil when necessary, and stacking the cr&amp;ecirc;pes as they are cooked.Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly oil an 11-by-7-inch or similar shallow baking dish or coat it with cooking spray.Spread about 2 tablespoons of the apple compote along the center of each cr&amp;ecirc;pe. Fold in quarters and arrange the cr&amp;ecirc;pes in the prepared baking dish. Bake, uncovered, until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Remove from the heat; stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon.
