degrees F. Spray a 6-cup doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray or lightly grease with butter.In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In another medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, canola oil, pumpkin puree, buttermilk and vanilla until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until the batter is smooth.Spoon the batter into the doughnut molds, filling to just below the top of each mold, 1/8 to 1/4-inch (3 to 6 mm) from the top. Bake for 20 to 26 minutes until lightly golden brown around the edges. The doughnuts are supposed to have a gooey center. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Slide a thin spatula around the edges of the doughnuts to help loosen them out. Then place on a cooling rack and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before glazing. Repeat with the remaining batter.To make the glaze, heat the milk until it begins to steam, remove from the heat and stir in the instant coffee. Allow to sit a minute or two and then whisk in the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla and salt until smooth. If the glaze is too thin, just add more powdered sugar until your desired thickness is reached. If the glaze is too thick, thin with more milk.Once the doughnuts have cooled, invert the doughnut into the glaze and let the excess drip off. If desired, sprinkle with chopped chocolate and pecans. The doughnuts can be stored, in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
