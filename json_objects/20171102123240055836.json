A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 18 small (4 ounce) canning jars with nonstick cooking spray. Place jars on a large baking sheet. Be sure to leave room between each of the jars for air to circulate while baking. 2. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and mix on low speed until combined.3. In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry.  With mixer still on low, add in the coffee stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The batter will be very thin.4. Using a large scoop, distribute the batter into the prepared canning jars, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Be sure you do not overfill the jars.5. Bake for 22-24 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Allow jars to cool for 5 minutes. 6. Once cakes have cooled for 5 minutes, use a wooden skewer to poke holes in the top of each cake. Spoon 2 teaspoons of caramel over the top of the warm cakes, allowing it to trickle into the holes. If desired, top each cake with whipped cream and Heath candy bar bits.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
