Stir in potatoes, sugar, shortening, salt, eggs and 5 cups flour; beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes. Place in a large greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.                                                                                            Punch dough down.
