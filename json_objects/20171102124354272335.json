Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 42 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage. Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose.
