Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maso Canali Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes.

Bring to a boil.  Add the edamame and cook until bright green but not soft, about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a large plate.  Add the tea bag to the water and return to a boil.  Cook the rice in the tea water according to package directions (it will take approximately 10 minutes).                                                                                                                              2                                                                            While the rice cooks, cook the fish.  Season the salmon with salt on both sides.  In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place the fish, presentation side down, in the skillet, and sear until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes. Using tongs or a fish spatula, carefully flip the fish over and cook on second side until barely cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Whisk the rice vinegar, water, sugar, mayonnaise, wasabi paste, and a pinch of salt together in a bowl.
