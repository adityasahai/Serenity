In a large bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt.2. Add the butter and mix until a dough forms. (It may take up to several minutes, but trust us, a dough will eventually form.) Add the milk and vanilla and mix until the dough is smooth. (Again, it may take a minute or more, but the dough will turn smooth. If you opted to use a spoon and not a stand mixer, you may have to eventually work the dough with your hands.)3. Mold the dough into one big blob, wrap it in plastic wrap or plunk it in a resealable container, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C) and butter a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.5. Roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thick between sheets of parchment paper. (If the dough is too hard to roll, let it stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes and then try again.) Cut out cookies with a round cookie cutter (or any shape you like). You can reroll any dough scraps. Place the cookies at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. (If the dough seems exceptionally sticky as you try to roll it, either return it to the fridge for a few minutes or, alternately, simply shape it into a log and slice it into rounds about 1/4-inch thick.)6. Bake for 8 minutes if you like a softer cookie, 10 minutes if you prefer a crisper cookie. If the cookies look a little soft when you take them out, don’t worry! They’ll firm up as they cool. Cool completely on the baking sheet or transfer to a wire rack after a few minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt.2.","ingredients":[{"id":19165,"name":"cocoa powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butter and mix until a dough forms.
