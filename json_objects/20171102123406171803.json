Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate.
