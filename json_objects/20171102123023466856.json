A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Heat over medium-high heat until sugar begins to melt. Do not stir -- rather, gently swirl the pan to help the sugar dissolve and continue melting. Lower heat slightly and continue to let the sugar simmer until it is all melted and amber in color. Pour into mold(s), tilting so all sides get coated.For the custard:Beat egg yolks and egg whites at high speed for about 1 minute. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, pumpkin, sugar, lime rind, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and vanilla. Beat for another 2 minutes. Strain, using a cheesecloth if necessary, and pour into mold(s). Lightly cover with foil.Place mold in a large baking pan. Add hot water to come up to half way up the mold. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the flan is set in the center.Alternative method: In a large pot, boil about 1 inch of water. Place mold in pot. Simmer for 40 minutes or until firm.Let flans cool, then place in refrigerator. When completely chilled, remove leche flan from mold.Release from mold:Run a sharp knife along the perimeter of the mold. Dip mold in a bowl of hot water to help loosen.
