The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Stretch/roll each pizza ball into a circle. Transfer to a pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Top each with tomato sauce, roughly torn prosciutto and top with mozzarella slices. Place in oven (I use a pizza stone) and bake for approximately 6-8 minutes until dough is golden and mozzarella is bubbly. WHILE pizza is baking (do this in batches), into a small non-stick egg pan crack egg and cook until whites have set. Season with salt/pepper. Set aside. Prior to serving: Top pizzas with arugula and fried egg. Garnish with drizzle of balsamic glaze if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Divide dough into 6 equal portions.
