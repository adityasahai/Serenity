Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Wrap the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil.In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the cookies and salt until they are into fine crumbs. Transfer to a medium bowl and add in the melted butter. Mix with a fork until crumbs are moist and together. Press evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared springform pan. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until crust is set. Let cool while you prepare filling.Beat the cream cheese, peanut butter and sugar on medium-high speed until creamy. Reduce speed to low and add in the condensed milk. Mix until combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in the vanilla and salt and beat for an additional minute. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the snickers by hand into the batter.Pour into the cooled crust and smooth the top. Gently give the pan a tap to release any air bubbles. Place the springform pan into a roasting pan with hot water; making sure the water comes halfway up the sides of the pan.Bake for 60- 70 minutes or until the center is just set. Allow to cool for at least an hour before running a knife through the edges of the pan and removing the sides of the pan. Continue to cool before refrigerating 3-4 hours before serving.To serve, top with chopped snickers and drizzle homemade with salted caramel sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
