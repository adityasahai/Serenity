Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Tiamo Chianti with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441645,"title":"Tiamo Chianti","description":"Intense ruby red with garnet tones.
