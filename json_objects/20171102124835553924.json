Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"In a medium bowl, combine cannellini beans, basil, oregano, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and white wine vinegar.Using a large, sharp knife, pierce spaghetti squash in several places. Place the squash in a glass baking dish and cook in the microwave on high for about 15 minutes, turning the squash halfway through cooking. Before handling, let the squash stand for 10 minutes.

Using a fork, twist out strands of the spaghetti squash flesh and place in a large bowl.Working in batches, stack the spinach leaves and cut across the leaves into 1/4-inch wide strips.In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add the sliced spinach and cook until the spinach is just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add feta cheese and the cannellini bean mixture.
