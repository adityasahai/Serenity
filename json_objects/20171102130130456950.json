Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Felsina Chianti Colli Senesi. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442678,"title":"Felsina Chianti Colli Senesi","description":"Deep ruby with violet hues.

Cover with luke warm water, let stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Drain well. Preheat oven to 425. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Add the mushrooms, drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss until well coated. Roast for 15 minutes, stir and roast for an additional ten minutes. Drain the liquid off the mushrooms, set mushrooms aside. Place the chicken broth in a saucepan and bring to a low simmer, keeping to warm, but not boiling.In a separate pot, heat the 3 tbs olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, but don’t allow to brown. Add the garlic and cook until you can smell it, about 20 secondsStir in the faro and 3 tablespoons butter, cooking until the farro is completely coated with butter and it smells slightly nutty, don’t allow to brown. About 2 minutes.Add 1 cup of the brown ale and cook until the pan begins to dry, stirring frequently. About 6 minutes.Add about ½ cup of broth into the farro. Stir frequently until the farro is almost dry, and then add another ½ cup and repeat until the farro is cooked. This process should take about 30 minutes. Don’t leave the risotto while it’s cooking, the farro on the bottom of the pan burns easily. (if you run out of broth, just use hot water the same way you would broth)Once your risotto is cooked through (taste it to verify that the farro is cooked and not crunchy), turn heat to low and add the cheese, cream, remaining 3 tablespoons butter and ¼ cup brown ale and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the roasted mushrooms just prior to serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add farro to a large bowl.
