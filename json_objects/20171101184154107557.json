In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. You could try Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425ºF. Have ready a heavyweight corn stick pan with 7 openings.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a small pan, melt the butter with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Use a pastry brush to brush the pan openings generously with the butter-oil mixture. Heat the pan in the oven for 5 minutes while you mix the batter.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the buttermilk, egg, and the remaining 1 tbsp oil and use a large spoon to stir the batter slowly just to combine the ingredients. You will see some small lumps; that’s okay.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Remove the pan from the oven and spoon about 2 tablespoons of the batter into each opening.

The bottoms of the corn sticks will be browned. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Use a small, sharp knife and your fingers to loosen the edges of the sticks and carefully remove the sticks from the pan to the rack. Do not turn the pan upside down to release the corn sticks because it could weigh them down and may break them. Serve warm.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            The corn sticks can be baked a day ahead, covered, and left at room temperature. To serve, preheat the oven to 275ºF and reheat the sticks, uncovered, until warm, about 10 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425ºF.
