If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

Place a small amount of filling (a generous tablespoon or two) in the center of the wonton.  Seal wonton by bringing the midpoints of each side together in the center, using water on edges if necessary to get a good seal.  Fry in small batches, in oil heated to 375 degrees F.  Rangoon will be done when light golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.
