Top with Swiss cheese,  cup sauerkraut, a layer of apple slices, and a layer of beet slices. Top with a second slice of bread, spread with more ginger mayonnaise if youd like. Repeat with the second sandwich.In a cast iron or other heavy skillet set over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil and butter.When the butter melts and begins to foam, carefully add the sandwiches, cheese side closest to the pan.
