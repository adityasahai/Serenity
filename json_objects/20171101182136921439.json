Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (1 Liter Bottle) with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 130 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434608,"title":"Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (1 Liter Bottle)","description":"This wine has a signature style that is dark in color, with rich fruit and ripe, velvety tannins – as approachable in youth as in maturity. Caymus farms Cabernet grapes in eight of Napa’s 16 sub-appellations, with diversification enabling the winery to make the best possible wine in a given year. This Cabernet offers layered, lush aromas and flavors, including cocoa, cassis and ripe dark berries.","price":"$129.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434608-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/caymus-napa-valley-cabernet-sauvignon-1-liter-bottle-2015/316997"}]},"instructions":"Cut meat into small pieces.
