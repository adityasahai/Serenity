Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Pre heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.In a small bowl combine turmeric, salt, ground coriander, and 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Toss the shrimp with the spice mixture until they are all evenly coated.Mix the garlic with half of the cilantro with 1tsp of olive oil.  Slice a deep slit in the back of each shrimp from the head down to the tail being careful not to slice through to the other side.  Stuff each shrimp with the garlic mixture and lay on the baking sheet.  Roast in the oven for 10 minutes or until the shrimp have cooked through.While the shrimp is cooking, toss the fennel with the rest of the cilantro and the limejuice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.Remove shrimp from the oven and place a mound of fennel in the middle of the plate surrounded by three big delicious shrimp.  Enjoy! Serves 2.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pre heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.In a small bowl combine turmeric, salt, ground coriander, and 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Toss the shrimp with the spice mixture until they are all evenly coated.","ingredients":[{"id":2012,"name":"ground coriander","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2043,"name":"turmeric","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turmeric.jpg"},{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the garlic with half of the cilantro with 1tsp of olive oil.  Slice a deep slit in the back of each shrimp from the head down to the tail being careful not to slice through to the other side.  Stuff each shrimp with the garlic mixture and lay on the baking sheet.  Roast in the oven for 10 minutes or until the shrimp have cooked through.While the shrimp is cooking, toss the fennel with the rest of the cilantro and the limejuice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png"},{"id":11957,"name":"fennel","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fennel.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Remove shrimp from the oven and place a mound of fennel in the middle of the plate surrounded by three big delicious shrimp.  Enjoy! ","ingredients":[{"id":11957,"name":"fennel","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fennel.jpg"},{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Serves 2.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
