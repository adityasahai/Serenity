White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Using a meat tenderizer, pound each side of the breast. It isn't necessary to pound them until very thin, just a few whacks per side to help tenderize them.Sprinkle each side of the breast with salt, pepper, and dried Italian seasoning according to your preferences.Heat the oil over medium heat in a 3.5 quart stove top safe pan that has a lid. I love my Le Creuset Enameled Cast-Iron 3.5 -Quart Round Braiser for jobs like this.Place the chicken breasts in the pan and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes per side. After browning the chicken, sprinkle them with freshly grated Parmesan. Pour the sauce over and cook covered on low to medium-low heat for 30 minutes.Remove the lid and arrange the zucchini on top in between the chicken pieces. At this time also layer a slice of fresh mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken. Replace lid and cook for another 15 minutes on low heat.Sprinkle with fresh parsley and basil, if desired, for a garnish and serve alongside pasta.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare 1/2 of a batch of Aimee's wonderful 4-Ingredient Tomato Sauce - this can be done in advance and refrigerated for a day or two or stored in the freezer.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut each chicken breast in half.
