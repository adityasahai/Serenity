White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"1.
