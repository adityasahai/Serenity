Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Garnet Monterey Pinot Noir with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444323,"title":"Garnet Monterey Pinot Noir","description":"This is a Pinot with power, but also with finesse.

Blend until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Feel free to add more soymilk if you prefer a thinner dip. Set aside.For the taquitos, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.Heat the olive oil in a fry pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the black beans and corn to the pan. In a small bowl, stir together the taco seasoning and water. Pour over the black bean mixture and stir until well-coated. Stir in the jalapeno. Remove the mixture from the heat.Warm the tortillas in the microwave covered in a damp paper towel for about 30 seconds. Take about 2 tablespoons of the black bean mixture and place down the middle of a tortilla. Roll the tortilla up nice and tight and place seam-side down on the cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spray each one with cooking spray. Bake for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue baking until lightly golden, about 5-10 minutes. Serve the creamy avocado dip.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the avocado dip, add the avocado, soymilk, lime juice, and adobo seasoning to a food processor or blender.
