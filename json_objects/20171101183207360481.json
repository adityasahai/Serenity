Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Crack the eggs into a large shallow bowl, add the milk, and beat well. Spread the flour and the crumbs in two separate bowls or pie plates. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Season the fish fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge one fillet in flour, lift it out, knock off excess flour, and place fillet in egg wash, making sure entire fillet is coated. Remove fillet from egg wash, letting excess drip off; place in crumbs. Gently press crumbs onto fish on both sides, coating it completely. Transfer breaded fillet to cooling rack; repeat process with remaining fillets.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Place a well-seasoned 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat; heat for 5 minutes. Add the oil and butter to skillet. Sprinkle a few crumbs into pan to test temperature—they should sizzle when they hit the fat. Lower fish fillets into hot fat, which should come halfway up sides of fish. As soon as crumbs begin to darken, reduce heat a bit. The key is even cooking, so that when you turn the fillets, they are a perfect golden brown. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes a side; the thicker the fish, the more slowly you should cook it—turn the heat down a bit more if necessary. Turn the fillets; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until golden brown. Add a little more oil and butter to pan if it appears dry.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Using a slotted spatula, transfer fish to individual plates or a platter.
