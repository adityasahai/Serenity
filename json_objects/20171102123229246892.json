Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

Cook, turning occasionally, until lightly blackened on all sides.  When done, place in a small plastic bag and let steam for a few minutes.
