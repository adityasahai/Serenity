Set the asparagus spears on a small baking sheet, drizzle about a teaspoon of sesame oil over them and toss gently to coat the spears with a light coat of oil. Drizzle a little soy sauce over the asparagus. Bake the asparagus for about 10 - 15 minutes or until the spears are crisp tender.When the asparagus is done, lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on a bamboo or silicon baking mat. Cover the nori with sushi rice, covering the nori completely. Dip your fingers in water to keep the rice from sticking. Press the rice down onto the nori to make a thin layer. Wet your fingers again and use the water to wet the rice on top a little bit. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, then flip the nori over so the nori is on top.Make a stripe of fillings about 1/3 of the way down the nori sheet. A stripe of smoked salmon, a stripe of asparagus, a few matchstick carrots, then a tiny drizzle of sriracha and a strip of cream cheese. Sprinkle the stripe with green onion. Since this is an \"inside out\" roll, you can use a bit more filling than the sushi with the nori on the inside.Roll up the sushi by folding the mat and nori/rice sheet over the toppings and pressing down and towards you, then slowly roll the rest of the roll, pressing to make a nice cylinder. When the sushi roll is complete, press a little more to ensure there are no air \"gaps\" in the middle.Using a very sharp, wet knife, cut the sushi into 1/2 - 3/4 inch thick slices.  Repeat as desired. Serve with wasabi, pickled ginger, and extra sriracha, for those who like it hot.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 F.
