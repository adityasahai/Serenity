Sparkling rosé are great choices for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 48 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":465202,"title":"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The Santa Lucia Highlands are known as one of the premier Pinot Noir appellations of the world. One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011/131978"}]},"instructions":"FOR THE PEPPERS: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Wash and pat dry a medium red bell pepper and poblano. Lightly spray them with olive oil. Once the grill is hot, set the peppers on the hottest part of your gill. Grill the peppers for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally until the skin chars and blisters. Remove and place into a clean bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the peppers sit for 15-20 minutes before removing. Peel the skin off, remove the stem and scrape out the seeds before dicing.Place a cup and a half of the black beans into a bowl. Smash them with a fork until only small pieces of bean remain. Set it off to the side.In a 4 to 5 quart Dutch oven; heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the celery, onion and garlic and saute until they're just starting to soften.Add the cumin, chipotle powder, smoked paprika and black pepper {about 1/4 teaspoon}. Stir and cook for another minute or two. Next add in the fire-roasted tomatoes, the bell pepper, poblano and corn. Pour in the 4 cups of vegetable broth and the portion of beans that are left whole. Stir and bring to a boil.Pour in the smashed black beans and stir. Reduce the temperature to simmer, cover and cook for 45 minutes. Taste and add salt to your preference before serving.Garnish with freshly torn cilantro leaves.EnjoyFOR THE QUESADILLAS: Preheat your griddle to 350 degrees and lightly spray or grease with olive oil. Lay down three tortillas and sprinkle a little of each of the cheeses over top {add pickled jalapenos if you like it spicy!}. Top each with a second tortilla and once the cheese has melted, flip. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the crispy top and add the final flour tortilla. Once the bottom is crispy and golden, flip and cook until that side is crispy.Cut into wedges and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"FOR THE PEPPERS: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
