Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. Tip: Rub a drop of the warm sugar mixture between your fingertips to make sure it feels smooth, with no trace of sugar granules. If the mixture feels sandy, continue warming and stirring until the mixture is smooth.Continue to heat until the mixture simmers, simmer for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low; add the chopped chocolate and stir until the chocolate is melted and thoroughly combined.Increase the heat to medium or medium high and bring to a boil, stirring frequently and scraping the pan bottom to avoid scorching, until the mixture reaches a temperature of 238 degrees F, a soft ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches about 230 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 238 degrees.Let the candy sit until the bubbling has stopped. Scatter the butter pieces on top of the hot candy and add the vanilla, but dont stir. After the candy has cooled a bit, give the candy a quick stir to combine the butter and vanilla but dont worry about completely combining at this step. Let candy sit until cooled to approximately 140 to 150 degrees.When candy is cooled to approximately 140 to 150 degrees, beat with a wooden spoon until the candy thickens slightly and just begins to lose its gloss, 1 to 2 minutes.Scrape the candy into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Tip: If candy is hard to smooth, pat smooth with your hands.Set aside while preparing the Peanut Butter Fudge layer.

Tip: If candy is hard to smooth, pat smooth with your hands. Set aside while preparing the topping.In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt chocolate. Or, place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, use 50% power and stir frequently just until the chocolate is melted; do not overheat as chocolate will burn easily. Stir in the shortening. Set aside to cool. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Turn the heat off and place a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl on top of the hot water, the upper pan should not touch the water.Spread the melted chocolate over the top of the peanut butter fudge layer, smoothing with a small offset spatula. Sprinkle the chopped peanuts over the top and gently press into the candy. Cut into approximately 1-inch squares before completely set. Let set about 1 to 4 hours to completely cool and become firm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large heavy-bottomed pan, combine granulated sugar, whipping cream, whole milk, and corn syrup.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1001053,"name":"whipping cream","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":19350,"name":"corn syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"whole milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved.
