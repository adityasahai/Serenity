Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry.

Line two 9-inch (22-cm) baking pans with parchment paper. Set aside.Whisk together the rice flours, potato starch, milk powder, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light in colour and fluffy.Add the eggs and egg whites, one at a time, running the mixer in between, allowing the mixture to become smooth before adding the next egg/egg white.Add the sour cream, vanilla extract and almond extract.With the mixer running on low, add half of the flour mixture to the sugar/butter mixture. Run the mixer until it is combined.Add the milk, and continue mixing until combined.Add the last of the dry ingredients, and mix until all the ingredients are evenly mixed.Divide the batter between the two prepared baking pans. Bake in preheated oven for 27-33 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.Leave the cakes in the pans for about 5 minutes before turning out on a cooling rack and allowing to cool completely before frosting.Beat together all the ingredients until smooth. Start with 1/2 cup (125 ml) cream, and add more, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time, until you get a nice soft, smooth consistency that still holds its shape. If you accidentally add too much cream, add a little more confectioners sugar. This is a LOT of frosting, but piping the roses uses a lot of frosting.Frost the top of one of the cakes, and stack the second cake on top. Using an offset spatula, coat the cake with a thin layer of frosting. It doesnt need to be smooth or pretty, just coated. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to let the frosting set before piping the roses.Fit a piping bag with a large star tip (I use the Wilton 1M tip). Fill with the buttercream.To see how to make the roses, watch my video on YouTube.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C).
