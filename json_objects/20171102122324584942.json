Turn heat to medium, and cook until crispy, flipping occasionally with a pair of tongs. Remove bacon and drain on paper towels. Spread one tablespoon of mustard on each slice, and then break each in half.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Smear one-quarter of the sauce on top of four slices of toast.
