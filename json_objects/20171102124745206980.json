Thinly slice the rind lengthwise, then roughly chop them crosswise into smaller pieces. Transfer the rind to a large pot and add the wine, baking soda, and 1 1/4 cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the rinds have softened, 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, coarsely chop the oranges and remove any seeds. Transfer the oranges to a food processor and pulse until the orange pieces are broken up but still chunky, about 8 pulses. Add the oranges to the pot with the rind and bring to a simmer. Simmer, covered, 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Measure the mixture. You should have about 5 cups. (If you have less, add a bit more wine. If you have more, discard the extra.) Stir in the pectin and butter and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Add the sugar all at once and return the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil hard for 1 minute.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Remove the pot from the heat and skim any foam from the surface of the marmalade with a cold metal spoon.
