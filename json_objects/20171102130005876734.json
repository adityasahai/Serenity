A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Microwave for 1 minute; stir chocolate well. Microwave for another 30 seconds; stir until chocolate is smooth. (If necessary, microwave in additional 15-second increments, stirring between each one, until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.)Use a small soft brush or a small measuring spoon to completely coat the inside of each paper or foil liner with chocolate. Place muffin pan in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Check for any thin areas in the chocolate and brush or spoon on more melted chocolate as necessary, making sure that the layer of chocolate around the top edge of the liner is thick enough. Return pan to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours or until firm, preferably overnight. Alternatively, you may place pan in the freezer for less time, until chocolate is completely hardened. Carefully peel the liner off of each chocolate cup.Pour heavy cream into a large bowl along with vanilla and 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat the cream until stiff peaks form. Scrape whipped cream into a separate bowl and set aside.Without cleaning mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and ¼ cup powdered sugar until smooth. Mix in cherry preserves until well incorporated. Gently fold ¼ of whipped cream into cream cheese mixture. Repeat with remaining whipped cream, working ¼ at a time and taking care not to overmix.Scoop cheesecake filling into a gallon-sized plastic baggie and snip off one corner. Use bag to pipe cheesecake into each chocolate cup. Sprinkle tops with chocolate shavings or mini chocolate chips. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until chilled, and store any leftovers in the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a miniature muffin pan with 24 paper or foil mini baking liners.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404671,"name":"muffin tray","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-tray.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour ¾ cup chocolate chips and shortening into a microwave-safe bowl.
