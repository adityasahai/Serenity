Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Set aside.In a separate bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add egg and vanilla and mix well.Gradually add in flour mixture, making sure not to overwork the dough. You just want to make sure it is all combined.Carefully fold in chocolate chips and Rice Krispies. Refrigerate dough for about 15 minutes, maybe longer if you live in Texas like me. You want the dough cooled and easily formed into balls.Roll dough into even-sized balls and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet, one inch apart.Bake for 10 minutes. The cookies probably won't look done, but they are. Take them out of the oven and allow to cool on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes. Transfer to rack to continue cooling.
