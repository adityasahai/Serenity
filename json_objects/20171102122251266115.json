If you feel like going Greek with your Greek food, assyrtiko and moschofilero are both lovely white wines to pair with chicken, seafood, etc. Agiorgitiko is a full bodied red suitable for roasted meats and lamb. One wine you could try is Sigalas Assyrtiko Santorini. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 22 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438698,"title":"Sigalas Assyrtiko Santorini","description":"Straw blonde color with light shades of green, with a subtle nose ofcitrus fruit.

Arrange the delicata squash on a large baking tray lined with parchment paper and roast for 20-30 minutes or until fork-tender. Set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 425.Place the swiss chard in a large microwave-safe bowl with the water in it. Cover the bowl with a large dinner plate and microwave on high until the chard is wilted and decreased in volume by half, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl and let sit, covered, for 1 minute. Carefully remove the plate and transfer the chard to a strainer set in the sink. Using the back of a wooden spoon, gently press the chard against the side of the strainer to remove as much water as possible. Roughly chop the chard.Place the spinach in a large bowl and toss with the delicata squash, feta, yogurt, eggs, dill, garlic, black pepper, and salt. Set aside.Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay 1 phyllo sheet on the parchment and brush thoroughly with the olive oil. Repeat with 9 more sheets, brushing each with olive oil, for 10 layers total.Spread the filling evenly over the phyllo. Cover the filling with 6 more phyllo sheets, brushing with olive oil and sprinkling with parmesan cheese. Press down on the sheets to make sure there are no air bubbles. Using a sharp knife, cut the top three(ish) layers of parchment into 12 pieces. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until phyllo is crisp and golden. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400.
