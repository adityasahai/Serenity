Coat an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray.Cream the butter, sugar, and brown sugar together with a mixer until creamy and smooth.

Add the oatmeal mixture to the butter mixture and mix well.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.  The filling will be sticky so wet your hands to pat the dough down into the pan.  Place into the oven to bake for 15-17 minutes or until golden brown. While the cookie base is baking combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and milk together until well combined.  Place the mixture into a small ziplock bag and seal.Remove the cookie base from the oven and pour the chocolate chips on top while it's still hot so the chocolate chips will melt and ooze all over the cookie base.   Cut a small piece out of the corner of the bag filled with the glaze then drizzle the peanut butter glaze on top of the chocolate chips.  Allow to cool before cutting into bars and serving.
