Mash periodically, adding more water as necessary. I always seem to use a cup or more of water as my figs are very dry. You want the end moisture to be thick and moist like a thick jelly. Just keep mashing around until the pieces are mostly broken down. If you have kiddos averse to texture, you could puree the mixture in a food processor.In a large mixing bowl, mix the chia meal and room temp milk. Add in the palm sugar and vanilla. While continually whisking, pour in the melted coconut oil.Sprinkle in the dry ingredients, in order.Using your whisk,lightly mix the dry ingredients before whisking more thoroughly into the wet. Stir until a wet dough is formed.Rolling the two cookie crusts/assembly:Roll out one 8 x 8 square. Use at least one piece of parchment, and another piece of either a greased or floured piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Roll the dough out between the two sheets. This keeps the sticky dough away from your rolling pin.Remove the top piece, leaving the dough directly on the parchment.Lift the paper with the dough and place into an 8 x 8 baking dish.Spread the filling evenly over the bottom crust.The top crust is trickier as you have to remove both pieces that you rolled between. Flouring generously each sheet helps with this. Flour or grease both pieces of plastic wrap or waxed paper thoroughly. Roll the remaining dough out to apx an 8 x 8 square. Gently remove the top piece, and lift the remaining piece: invert on top of the filling. It does not have to look perfect!Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes until golden. Let cool completely before cutting...if you can wait that long!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, cook the filling ingredients over a low simmer for 10-20 minutes.
