A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Stir a few times during this time to make sure all the fruits get a good soaking.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the pumpkin, sugar, eggs, oil, and vanilla. Stir till it's all mixed up well.Add the flours, flaxmeal, baking powder, salt, baking soda, spices, and nuts. Stir until the batter is mixed well and there are no pockets of flour anywhere. Add the drunken fruits with any \"juice\" that's not soaked up and stir them gently into the batter too.Spray a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray, then pour the batter in and smooth it out with a spatula. Sprinkle the top with a few extra nuts and some Turbinado sugar.Bake at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until a wooden pick or knife inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.

Remove from oven and allow it to cool off a bit.While the bread is cooling, mix up the glaze by mixing the powdered sugar with the rum and amaretto till smooth. The glaze should be very thin and syrupy. Remove the bread from its baking pan and set it on a serving plate. Drizzle the glaze over the bread and down the sides.
