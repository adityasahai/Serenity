Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general.

Season both sides of pork with salt and black pepper. Add pork to the skillet and cook 2 minutes per side, until golden brown.                          In a medium bowl, using a spoon, combine orange marmalade, broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well and add to the pork in the pan.
