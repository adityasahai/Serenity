chopping and prep work complete before you start the roux, it will take all of your attention once you get started.-be patient with the roux process; it will take about an hour-and-a-half to reach the right color. to prep the soup pots:Fill two (20-quart) stock pots with salted water and bring them to a boil. for the roux:While the water comes to a boil, make the roux.  Melt the shortening over medium heat in a cast-iron skillet until it\'s melted - don\'t rush this step.  Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon.  Once melted, add the flour until a sort-of paste forms. (Note: always add equal parts of flour to the shortening.)Stir the roux continuously with a wooden spoon and continue to stir as the roux changes color.  It will start very light in color and will progress as it cooks (see image above for color progression).  Cook the roux for about 90 minutes and watch the color change as you go.  You will know it\'s finished when you reach a "dark chocolate" color. Be very patient - the roux burns very easily. to finish the gumbo:Once Roux is a dark chocolate color, turn off the heat, stand back, and carefully add a little of the boiling water to the roux to "loosen it up".  Be very careful during this part - it will be a little messy too!  The roux is very active at this time.  Stir carefully to get as much of the water and roux to mix \u2013 then carefully pour half of the roux into one pot and half into the other pot.  The water should now look like dirty dish water.
