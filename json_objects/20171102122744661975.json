White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate.
