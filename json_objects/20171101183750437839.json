Add a little bit of water (1-2 Tbsp) to make a paste that can be spread easily over the squash.Place the squash pieces in a glass or ceramic baking dish so that they are in a single layer, not overlapping, and cut sides are facing up. Spread the spice mix liberally over all cut surfaces of the squash (don't season the skin side).Roast the squash in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to one hour, or until the edges are golden brown and the squash is easily pierced with a fork.
