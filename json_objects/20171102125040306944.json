In the same pan, cook kale and brussels sprouts over medium-high heat, stirring often to prevent burning. Cook about 10 minutes until veggies are soft. Add garlic and cook 1-2 minutes more. Add white wine and cook until wine is evaporated. Meanwhile, heat about 1/4 cup of coconut oil in a small saut pan. Heat until hot and bubbly. Fry corn tortillas about 30 seconds each side. Let drain on a paper towel. To assemble tacos, spread each tortilla with a smear of whipped feta. Scoop a healthy dose of veggies on the tortilla. Top with crumbled bacon.
