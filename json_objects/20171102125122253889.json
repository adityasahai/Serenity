A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Beat the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.Lastly fold the walnuts and chocolate chips into the cake. Pour the batter into the bundt pan and spread it evenly. Bake 45-50 minutes. Keep an eye on the cake towards the end; sometimes you just need a couple extra minutes. Check the cake for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cake.

Allow the cake to cool.For the topping: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips, heavy whipping cream and corn syrup. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring occasionally until the chocolate is melted.Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cake and then sprinkle the top with toasted coconut and walnuts.This cake is best served slightly warmed.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the cake: Preheat the oven at 350F and generously grease a large bundt pan.In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, instant pudding, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice, gently stirring to combine.Next add the eggs, vegetable oil, milk, sweetened condensed milk, and sour cream.
