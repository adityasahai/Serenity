White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"Place 1-1.5 cups of ginger cilantro marinade in a large ziploc bag.

Add duck fat to the pan and make sure the pan is extra hot.Add chicken and butternut squash, making sure to not overcrowd the pan since you are trying to get a sear on the chicken.Use a couple tablespoons of marinade from the ziploc bag to pour on top of the butternut squash.Flip the chicken after about 4 minutes to sear the other side for another 4 minutes, and move the butternut squash around to help cook on all sides.Place in oven for 15-18 minutes, depending how thick the chicken breasts are.While the chicken is cooking, place almonds in a small saucepan over medium heat to toast the almonds. Move them around until all sides are slightly brown, but not burned.When chicken is done cooking, top with toasted almonds and sliced green onions.Love flavor in chicken.
