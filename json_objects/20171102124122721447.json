A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.","productMatches":[{"id":430931,"title":"St. Barthelemy Cellars Zinfandel Port","description":"A deep ruby red color that sparkles in the glass describes this Zinfandel port. The aromas are a complex mixture of licorice, blackberry, and a whisper of vanilla. The rich jammy taste has hints of licorice, herbs, spice and currants with a lingering finish of almond and anise. Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Ch√®vre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line pans with cupcake liners (makes about 30 cupcakes). Place a Golden Oreo in the bottom of each liner. Place bananas in a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher until completely smushed. Add cake mix, oil, eggs, and water. Mix for 30 seconds on low speed with a hand mixer, then 2 minutes on medium. Scoop into prepared pans, filling about 3/4 full. Bake for 14-15 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting. To make frosting: beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Slowly add powdered sugar and mix, 1 cup at a time, until combined. Add vanilla and beat until smooth. If needed to reach piping consistency, add a tablespoon of heavy cream (or 2). I didn't need to use any cream. Frost or pipe onto cupcakes (I used a 1M tip) and top with a 1/2 or full Golden Oreo. Store in refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
