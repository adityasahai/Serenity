Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Cream together at high speed for a few minutes with a hand or stand mixer until becoming fluffy.  Add one room temperature egg and whip a few for minutes.Mash 2 large bananas to make about 1 cup of “banana mush” and mix 1 tsp of baking soda and let set for a few minutes.Mix the banana into the butter. Mix well. Add 2 cups flour, 1 pinch of salt, and ½ tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. As I said in the discussion, I would cut back the nutmeg and cloves to ¼ tsp.Add 1 cup chopped nuts or chocolate chips and mix.Prep 2 baking trays with parchment paper. I like a larger cookie so I used an ice cream scoop that make a larger cookie.Cook until edges are turning a bit darker brown. These large cookies took 15 minutes. A smaller cookie might take as little as 12 minutes. Allow to rest on the tray for 5 minutes after coming out of the oven before moving to cooling rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Allow 1 stick (1/2 cup) of unsalted butter and 1 egg to rest to room temperature.In a mixing bowl add 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter at room temperature and 1 cup sugar.
