A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.
