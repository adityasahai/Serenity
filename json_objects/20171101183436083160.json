The batter will be very thick and a bit lumpy. Fold in the white chocolate chips and then very gently (so they don't break up) fold in most of the raspberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin then add a few of the remaining raspberries to the top of each muffin, making sure to push them down gently into the batter. Sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.Place into the oven and bake at 425 for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 and continue baking for 13-15 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes in the pan before moving them to a cooling rack. Serve plain or with butter.
