Since the Match Light briquets are infused with lighter fluid you’ll only use them for the initial stage of getting the coals hot.  The coals added later in the cooking process will just be the regular (non-Match Light) charcoal briquettes.  Carefully light up the coals with a fire starter.  Let the coals get hot (about 45 minutes).Preparing the Turkey:  While the coals are getting hot, drizzle the melted butter over the turkey (in the cavity too).  Then sprinkle the entire turkey (including the cavity) with the garlic powder, salt, and pepper.Cooking the Turkey:  Once the coals are hot (they will turn a gray color), put the pan for the drippings in between the charcoal rails.  Put the hinged cooking grate in the BBQ.  Put the turkey on the cooking grate right over the dripping pan.  Put the lid on the BBQ.  Every hour, (starting from when the initial coals were added) add 10 regular mesquite coals (not the Match Light coals) to each side of the charcoal rails.About 15 minutes after putting the turkey on the grill, take off the lid, open the hinged cooking grates, and add 10 regular mesquite coals to each side.  Then put the lid back on.  Then for every hour thereafter, continue to add 10 regular mesquite coals (not the Match Light coals) to each side of the charcoal rails.  If the turkey is getting too brown on the top before it's done cooking, no worries, just put a piece of foil on the top of the turkey.  Every ½ hour or so, use a bulb-type baster to transfer the liquid from the cavity of the turkey, to the top of the turkey.This is not required but if you happen to have a citrus tree in your patio or yard, add some of the leaves to the coals during the last hour for some added flavor.  When the turkey's done cooking, remove it from the grill on to a large platter to let it rest for about 30 minutes before cutting.  Using sturdy hot mitts, carefully remove the dripping pan from the grill. Use these drippings to make your gravy.Deciding When to Start the Cooking Process1) First decide when you want to serve the turkey….hold that thought.2) Then do the math to determine how long it will take to cook the turkey; Cooking time is 11 minutes per pound (without stuffing); (13 minutes per pound      with stuffing)3) Then add 45 minutes for putting the starter coals in the BBQ and for them to get hot.4) Then add 30 minutes for the turkey to rest after it’s cooked.5) Add all of the cooking times in numbers 2, 3, and 4 above to determine when to start.For example;1. I want to have dinner at 5 pm.2. My unstuffed 19 pound turkey will take 3.5 hours to cook; 19 multiplied by 11 minutes = 209 minutes; 209 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour = 3.48 hours.  Which rounds to 3.5 hours3. Add 45 minutes for putting the coals in the BBQ and for them to get hot.4. Add 30 minutes for the turkey to rest after it’s cooked.5. The total time for the turkey is 4 hours and 45 minutes (3.5 hours, plus 45 minutes, plus 30 minutes).I’ll need to start my 19 pound unstuffed turkey at 12:15 pm to have it ready for dinner at 5 pm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Determine when you should start the cooking process (see the explanation below on how to do this).Preparing the Grill:  To start, put some plastic gloves on and add 25 Match Light with Mesquite briquets on each side of the BBQ inside the charcoal rails.
