In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the vegan butter and powdered sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla and continue to beat. With the mixer on low, slowly add the flour and beat until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Transfer the dough onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and knead it a few times to bring completely together (the dough will start out crumbly). Once dough is soft, top with another piece of parchment paper and roll out 1/8-1/4\" thick.Use a 2” cookie cutter to cut out approximately 40 rounds. Place cookies on prepared cookie sheets about 1\" apart. Knead excess dough back together and roll out once more, working to cut out as many cookies as possible. Before baking, place cookie sheet in the freezer for about 15 minutes.Remove chilled cookies and bake for 10-12 minutes. Allow cookies to chill for 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.for the cookie dough filling:In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt, set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the vegan butter and sugars for 2-3 minutes, until light and fluffy.
