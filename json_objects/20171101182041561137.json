A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.","productMatches":[{"id":430931,"title":"St. Barthelemy Cellars Zinfandel Port","description":"A deep ruby red color that sparkles in the glass describes this Zinfandel port. The aromas are a complex mixture of licorice, blackberry, and a whisper of vanilla. The rich jammy taste has hints of licorice, herbs, spice and currants with a lingering finish of almond and anise. Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Chèvre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"Add all your ingredients to a large bowl. If you want the ice cream to be extra smooth, strain the mixture through a sieve to remove the blackberry seeds (I don't always do this, but it makes the texture nicer).                                  Add the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. I suggest sticking the finished ice cream in the freezer for at least an hour before serving to harden it even more.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add all your ingredients to a large bowl.
