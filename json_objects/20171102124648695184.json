Blanc are great choices for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, give it a stir, cover, then reduce the heat to medium-low / low and let simmer for about 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let the pan sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff the quinoa with a fork.Meanwhile, season the chicken pieces with a little bit of salt and pepper. Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. When hot, add the chicken to the pan. Toss to coat and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through and browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. With the skillet still over medium heat, add in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add in the onion, carrots and broccoli. Cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, until crisp tender. Turn off the heat. Add the chicken back to the pan (including any juices) as well as the cashews and the cooked quinoa. Mix to combine.In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, zest, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic and ginger. Add in the olive oil and whisk vigorously until combined. Pour the sauce into the skillet and mix until evenly coated. Scoop into bowls and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a medium saucepan.
