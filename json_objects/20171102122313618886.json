Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off the drippings into a small heatproof bowl, leaving about 1 Tbs. drippings in the pan. Set the pan, reserved drippings and bacon aside. Brown the beef: In a sealable plastic bag, add the beef chunks, 1 tsp sea salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper and shake to coat. Return the fry pan to medium-high heat. When the drippings are hot, add half of the beef chunks and cook, turning once, until well browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the beef to the slow cooker. Repeat with the remaining beef chunks, adding the reserved drippings if needed. Scatter the onions, carrots, celery, sweet potato, and garlic on top. Cook the stew: Add broth, tomato paste, and balsamic vinegar to the vegetables and beef and stir to combine. Place bay leaf on top and cover and cook on the high-heat setting for 4 to 5 hours or the low-heat setting for 8 to 9 hours. The beef should be very tender. Stir in the reserved bacon, parsley, thyme and the rosemary. Cook, uncovered, on the high-heat setting for 10 minutes more to thicken the sauce slightly. Season with salt and pepper and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the bacon: In a large fry pan over medium heat, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/paper-towels.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour off the drippings into a small heatproof bowl, leaving about 1 Tbs. drippings in the pan.
