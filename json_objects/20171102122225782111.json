White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.
