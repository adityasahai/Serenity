In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Chateau Ste.

Preheat oven to 375F. Line muffin tin with cupcake liners. In a large bowl, add all the cornbread ingredients and mixwith a whisk until everything is blended. Scoop batter into cupcake liners, filling between 1/2 to 2/3 full. You should be able to make 12 muffins.2. In a separate bowl, add all the filling ingredients and mix together. Scoop a heaping 1 tbsp of stuffing into the middle of each muffin. Try to make sure each one has an even amount of all the stuffing ingredients.
