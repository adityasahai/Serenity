Keep it at a rolling boil, stirring frequently. This entire step will take 6-7 minutes if you care to time it. It will thicken and go a darker shade (similar to butterscotch). At this point, add the vanilla, and stir a few more times. You'll know its done as you'll know that if you go longer, it will burn.

QUICKLY place the other sheet of parchment on top and press out (put oven mitts on as its hot, or use your other cookie sheet).
