Whether you serve them as a meatless main course piled on top of zoodles or pasta, or served as an appetizer, these eggplant meatballs are delish!There's a restaurant in my neighborhood that recently closed down and the eggplant meatballs are the one item on the menu I'll miss the most. Rather than getting upset, I set out to recreate them in my kitchen and I think I succeeded! I shared them with my neighbor and my cousin and they both raved and wanted the recipe. These are great for vegetarians or if you're like me, just looking to incorporate more plant based foods into my diet.To speed this up, I simmered the \"meatballs\" in DeLallo's Basil Pomodoro sauce. Coming from a girl who won't use sauce from a jar, DeLallo does it right and is the only one I would use if I wasn't making it from scratch. If you want to make your own sauce, you can use my quick marinara recipe here instead.Eggplant \"Meatballs\"Skinnytaste.comServings: 6  Size: 4 meatballs  Old Points: 6 pts  Points+: 7 ptsCalories: 259  Fat: 12 g  Protein: 9 g  Carb: 30 g  Fiber: 6 g  Sugar: 7 gSodium: 1180 mg  Cholesterol: 39 mgIngredients:cooking spray1/2 tbsp olive oil1 1/4 lbs unpeeled eggplant, cut into 1-inch pieceskosher salt1/4 tsp black pepper2 garlic cloves, crushed2 tbsp chopped basil, plus leaves for garnish1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned breadcrumbs1 large egg, beaten2 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated, plus more for serving1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley1 (25.25 ounce jar) DeLallo Pomodoro saucepart skim ricotta cheese, for serving (optional)Directions:Heat the oven to 375F.
