Make a well in the center of the pot and add the garlic, cumin, chili powder, coriander, ground pepper, paprika and mustard. Stir for about 1 minute until fragrant and then stir spices into the vegetable mixture. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the tequila. Put the pot back over over the heat and cook until tequila has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in the salsa, chilis, soaked and drained beans, chicken stock, worcestershire sauce, tabasco and sea salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam that rises to the top and discard. Lower heat to a simmer and let chili simmer for 4-5 hours, or until beans are soft. Stir in the chopped chicken breasts. Serve with toppings.For the Dixie Chicken:Stir together olive oil, fermeted tamari, sherry, honey, lime, garlic and pepper in a measuring cup.
