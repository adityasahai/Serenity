A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Scatter the pieces of butter over the mixture.  Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse yellow meal without any white powdery bits remaining, about 20 pulses.  Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.  Beat the egg yolks with cream and vanilla and pour them into the flour-butter mixture.  Toss with a spatula until the dough clumps together.  If the dough is too dry, add 1 more tablespoon of heavy cream (better too wet than too dry).  Divide the dough in half, form into disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Just before you are ready to roll out the dough, prepare the filling.  Warm the golden syrup in a saucepan until it is runny, or microwave it for 1 minute.  Combine the golden syrup, breadcrumbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl and mix well.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator.  On a floured surface, roll out the larger disk into an 11-inch circle.  Fold it into quarters, brush off excess flour with a pastry brush after each fold, then unfold it into a 9-inch tart pan, easing the sides gently into the pan and pressing the dough down into the fluted edges.  Trim the dough even with the rim.  Roll out the second disk 1/8-inch thick.  Cut the dough into long strips for the lattice topping.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Scrape the filling into the prepared crust and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.  Lay half the strips of dough over the filling in one direction and the other half in the opposite direction to form a lattice.  Trim the overhang.  Gently brush the beaten egg over the lattice.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375°F and bake for another 25 minutes until the crust is browned and the filling puffs up in the center.
