Slowly, few drops at a time, add enough water until the mixture forms a soft dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes for up to 3-4 days. Once chilled, roll the dough out on a floured surface and line it on the bottom and sides of a 9\" pie crust, preferably with removable bottom. Heat the oven to 375F. Prick the pie crust all over with a fork, cover with parchment paper and fill with baking beans. Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the baking beans and paper and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes until slightly golden. Cool completely. While the pie crust is cooling, make the pudding. In a medium size saucepan, whisk the milk, egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch. Cook the mixture over low heat until thickened, stirring constantly, approximately 10 minutes. Divide the pudding into two bowls. In a heatproof bowl melt the chocolate and stir it into half of the pudding. Spread the chocolate pudding in the pie crust, cover with a plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Place the 3 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl and sprinkle with gelatine while whisking with a fork. Set aside for 5 minutes or until spongy.Stand the bowl in a heatproof bowl of hot water and stir until the gelatine dissolves. Never boil gelatine, as it can become stringy. Stir the gelatin into the reserved pudding along with the vanilla extract. In a grease-free bowl, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar until peaks form. Slowly add in the sugar and continue whisking until firm peaks are formed. Fold the egg whites into the vanilla pudding and spoon it over the chocolate pudding layer. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set. Whip the heavy cream until firm peaks and spread it over the vanilla pudding and decorate with chocolate shavings. Cut with a sharp knife and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the flour, butter and egg yolks in a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles bread crumbs.
