Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Prepare all the seasonings. Read the instructions on the package, and then cook noodles accordingly (I recommend reducing around 1 minute cooking time based on the time given by the manufacturer). Transfer out and add 2 teaspoons of oil immediately (This will help to avoid the noodles being sticky with each other). Stir to mix well. Use chopsticks to stir the noodles up repeatedly to help the noodles cool down quickly. In hot days, you can even resort to an electric fan.When the noodles are completely cooled down, add shredded cucumber and all the other seasonings. Mix well and serve cold. How to fry soybeans: pre-soak the soybeans until double in size. Drain completely and then fry with oil until crisp.You can add bean sprouts or crisp pickles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare all the seasonings.
