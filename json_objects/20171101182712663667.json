Place the florets into a large pot with a few inches of water on the bottom. Cover and bring to a boil. Turn down to medium and let steam for about 5 minutes or until you can pierce easily with a fork. While the cauliflower is steaming, cook your sweet potato. Pierce a few times with a fork and then microwave for about 3-5 minutes or until you can easily pierce with a fork. NOTE: I decided to keep the skin on, but feel free to peel the skin before microwaving. Drain cauliflower from as much water as possible and transfer the into a large food processor. Cut sweet potato in half and then in half again and place in food processor as well. Add in about 1/2 cup of almond milk, salt and pepper to taste, and butter, and process until combined. You may need to stop a few times to scrape the sides. It should be very similar to mashed potato consistency. Place in a large tupperware or bowl and into the refrigerator to let cool.  Once cooled, prepare your cakes by adding in an egg, cheddar cheese, chives, and oat flour. This should thicken up the consistency of the mash a little bit. Using a 1/4 cup scooper, create a ball in your hand and then mash into a cake.Heat a nonstick pan to medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place cakes onto pan (I did three at a time) and let cook for about 2 minutes or until golden brown, covered. Flip cakes and let cook for an additional 2 minutes, covered. Top with nonfat Greek yogurt, jalapeos, cheddar cheese, and a sprinkle of paprika.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, begin by steaming cauliflower.","ingredients":[{"id":11135,"name":"cauliflower","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the florets into a large pot with a few inches of water on the bottom.
