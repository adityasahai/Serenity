Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439521,"title":"Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot","description":"Taltarni Three Monks is a Cabernet-Merlot blend that combines two very compatible grape varieties sourced from Victoria. It is set to complement Taltarni's reputation for remarkable Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.The medium-bodied palate is soft, smooth and fills the mouth with ripe berry flavours which are complimented with subtle oak and vanilla. The finish is fresh and clean.Designed for perfect enjoyment on release, it will also reward cellaring.
