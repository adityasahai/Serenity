Place in refrigerator for an hour to chill. Then roll mixture into balls, about 5/8'' in diameter. Place the balls in the bottom of a 9'' x 13'' pan, in a single layer, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.In a medium bowl, melt almond chocolate bark (and bittersweet chocolate, if desired, for a little deeper chocolate flavor) in short intervals in the microwave, stirring at each interval. Take care to not let it scorch. You could also use a double boiler for this. Let melted chocolate bark cool a bit before proceeding. Then place a bit of chocolate bark into the bottom of up to 6 bon bon cups. Gently top each chocolate layer with a peanut butter ball and then add more melted chocolate bark to cover the peanut butter balls. If topping with sprinkles, decorate these 6 peanut butter cups now, before the chocolate bark sets. Then proceed with creating 6 more, and so on, until completed.These freeze extremely well. Just separate layers with wax paper.(Helpful tip: If you have leftover chocolate bark, stir in any nuts you like, and mini marshmallows are good, too. Then drop mixture by big spoonfuls onto wax paper and allow to set. This makes an awesome sweet treat!)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, combine peanut butter, powdered sugar, and butter.","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg"},{"id":16098,"name":"peanut butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place in refrigerator for an hour to chill.
