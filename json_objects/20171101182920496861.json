Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Add the cream cheese and pulse until the mixture is smooth and well-blended, stopping to scrape down the sides of the food processor once or twice if needed.(If you don't have a food processor, you can crush the Oreos in a large ziplock bag, and then stir/mix in the cream cheese by hand.)Use a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop to portion the dough into 1/4-cup balls. Then roll by hand into egg shapes. Place the eggs on parchement-lined baking sheets, and chill in the refrigerator (or freezer) until hardened.Once the eggs have chilled, carefully heat half of the almond bark in a microwave or double-boiler until melted and smooth. (*If the almond bark is too thick, add in a few teaspoons or shortening or coconut oil to thin.) Dip the egg in the melted almond bark, and roll around until it is evenly coated. Transfer the egg to another parchement-lined baking sheet and let cool. Repeat with remaining eggs. Then transfer to the refrigerator once more to cool until the chocolate has hardened.Divide the remaining almond bark into separate bowls (for however many colors you wish to use), then stir in your food coloring until the almond bark reaches your desired shade. Either drizzle the colored almond bark on the eggs with a fork or use a piping bag to pipe the almond bark on in your desired design.Serve immediately or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the Oreos to a food processor, and pulse until evenly crumbled.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the cream cheese and pulse until the mixture is smooth and well-blended, stopping to scrape down the sides of the food processor once or twice if needed.(If you don't have a food processor, you can crush the Oreos in a large ziplock bag, and then stir/mix in the cream cheese by hand.)Use a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop to portion the dough into 1/4-cup balls.
