Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Peel, half, and slice the sweet potatoes into about 1/4 half circles.  Place the potatoes in a medium sauce pan and add the water.  Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and ginger.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook uncovered until the potatoes are still firm but tender - about 10 to 12 minutes.  Do not drain.In another bowl, make the dough by mixing the flour, cinnamon, and brown sugar together.  Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two large dinner forks.  (Don't stress over this - just do the best you can.)  Slowly pour the milk into the flour mixture while stirring.  Stir until the mixture is combined.  The dough will be crumbly and slightly sticky.  (see the photo)Spray a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Crumble about 1/3 of the dough into the bottom of the baking dish.  Remove the potatoes from the pan with a slotted spoon and place them evenly in the baking dish.  Measure 1 cup of the cooking liquid and pour it over the potatoes.  Crumble the  remaining dough over the potatoes and sprinkle the top with about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Bake for about 40 minutes or until golden brown and the dough is cooked through.  Allow to rest for about 10 minutes for the sauce to thicken before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 F.
