Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tramin Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448227,"title":"Tramin Pinot Grigio","description":"Bright yellow in color with coppery reflections and clear fruit aromas of pear, citrus, honeysuckle, tropical fruits and light spices.
