With rich, cheesy mac & cheese you'll want to cleanse the palate with something crisp and acidic. We recommend Chenin Blanc, Riesling, or dry Lambrusco if you're in the mood for a red.

Add 4 ounces of cheddar cheese and whisk until combined. Taste and season as needed with salt and pepper. Whisk in the salsa. Combine the cooked macaroni and the cheese sauce and pour into an ungreased 9×13-inch glass baking pan. It will be soupy – but don’t worry, the sauce will thicken upon standing and baking.
