The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not.

It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444888,"title":"Heinz Eifel Riesling Spatlese","description":"Heinz Eifel Riesling Spatlese is made from late-harvestedRiesling grapes in the middle Mosel Valley of Germany.

If using canned chickpeas, drain, rinse well and rub with paper towels to remove some of the skin. If using dried chickpeas: pour hot water over chickpeas and let soak over night. Press each chickpea between thumb and index finger to take skin off and dry on paper towel.2. In a large pot, saute pan or a wok (something with high sides as you will be tossing the chickpeas), heat up oil on medium-low, toss in chickpeas and fry for couple minutes while mixing. It will sizzle and achieve a slight golden sheen. Taste one, it will be crunchy from outside and soft inside. With a slotted spatula take out of pot/wok and drain on towel paper lined plate, sprinkle with salt and garam masala if you wish and set aside. Reserve the oil and the pot for the next step in recipe.3. Put the onion in a food processor and pulse until consistency is of finely grated onion. Add to same oil we fried the chickpeas in, turn the heat to medium-low and let cook until translucent to slightly golden, about 3 minutes. 4. Back to the food processor (no need to clean) - add the chillies, garlic and ginger. Pulse for a few seconds, scrape with a rubber spatula from the edges and pulse again for a finer chop. Add this mixture to onion in the pot and saute for an additional 3 minutes until very fragrant.5. Add the cabbage, turmeric, salt and six tablespoons of water and toss cabbage in the pot until slightly wilted.6. Plate cabbage and sprinkle with fried chickpeas. Garnish with a touch of cilantro if desired. I show it with samosas in the picture which I will feature in the future. Can be served with naan or any other Indian bread and chutneys.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If using canned chickpeas, drain, rinse well and rub with paper towels to remove some of the skin.
