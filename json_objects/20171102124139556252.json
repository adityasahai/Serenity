Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is District 7 Estate Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Peel the tomatoes by first scoring them on the bottom with an \"x\" and then submerging them in boiling water for 15 seconds. Immediately plunge the tomatoes into a bowl of ice water. The skins will peel right off.                          Quarter the tomatoes, then cut out the cores and remove the seeds. Add the tomatoes to a heavy medium pot, along with the red peppers, honey and Italian seasoning. Stir and cook over medium heat until the flavors have combined and the peppers and tomatoes have softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperaturethe mixture can be frozen at this at this stage.                          While the tomatoes cool, marinate the mozzarella. In a medium bowl, combine the mozzarella, olive oil, lemon zest and lemon juice.                          When the tomato mixture is completely cooled, strain off and discard the excess juice, and then add the mixture to the marinated mozzarella. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Garnish with basil before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Peel the tomatoes by first scoring them on the bottom with an \"x\" and then submerging them in boiling water for 15 seconds.
