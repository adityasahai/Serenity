Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439521,"title":"Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot","description":"Taltarni Three Monks is a Cabernet-Merlot blend that combines two very compatible grape varieties sourced from Victoria. It is set to complement Taltarni's reputation for remarkable Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.The medium-bodied palate is soft, smooth and fills the mouth with ripe berry flavours which are complimented with subtle oak and vanilla. The finish is fresh and clean.Designed for perfect enjoyment on release, it will also reward cellaring. It is an ideal choice matched with lamb veal or your favourite à la Carte meal, such as beef Carpaccio.Blend: 52% cabernet, 48% merlot   ","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439521-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/taltarni-three-monks-cabernet-merlot-2001/85340"}]},"instructions":"Let the roast sit at room temperature for 1 hour and 30 minutes.Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and spray your roasting rack with cooking spray.In a food processor (a mini processor works great here!) pulse the peeled garlic cloves until minced. Add in the chopped thyme, chopped rosemary, mustard and olive oil. Pulse until combined.Trim off any excess fat off of the roast and season the entire thing with the kosher salt and black pepper. Use your hands and rub the Dijon mixture over the entire roast.Place the roast on the prepared roasting rack and set into a large roasting pan and insert an oven-safe digital thermometer into the center of the thickest part of your roast.Bake at 400 degrees for thirty minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees (DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR) and cook for another 30 minutes.Pour in the 2 cups of beef broth and return the roast to the oven to cook for another 30-40 minutes or until the internal temp registers at 135 degrees.Remove the roast and let it rest on a carving board while you make the Au jus.Place the roasting pan with all of the drippings on two burners and bring to a boil. Pour in the 2/3 cup of Pinot Noir and cook, stirring often for 6 minutes or until it reduces to 3/4 of a cup.With a carving knife, slice the roast along the bones and set those off to the side. Slice the prime rib and serve with a tablespoon or so of the Au jus over top.Serves 12-14 people.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Let the roast sit at room temperature for 1 hour and 30 minutes.Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and spray your roasting rack with cooking spray.In a food processor (a mini processor works great here!) pulse the peeled garlic cloves until minced.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"whole garlic cloves","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add in the chopped thyme, chopped rosemary, mustard and olive oil.
