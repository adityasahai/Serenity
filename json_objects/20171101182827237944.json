Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in peanut butter and tahini if you're using tahini.2) Add wet ingredients and combine well. Let sit for 5 minutes.3) Lay out a sheet of parchment paper in your sheet pan. Add 1/4 of the flake batter to the parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap.4) Use a rolling pin or something to flatten the batter out into a very thin layer over the parchment paper. You should almost be able to see through it.5) Remove plastic wrap leaving just batter and parchment paper.6) Bake for about 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees and turn the pan once halfway through. Let flakes cool when they come out.7) Once cool, use your fingers or a dough scraper to cut the sheet into flakes. Repeat with all the batter. You can do more than one sheet pan at a time.8) Once all your flakes are made, add them all back to a sheet pan and turn the oven down to 250 degrees.9) Bake the flakes a second time for 20-30 minutes at 250 degrees to further crisp them up. Stir the flakes every 10 minutes.10) Store in an airtight plastic bag and serve with granola, dried fruit, and milk.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl.
