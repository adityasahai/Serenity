processor.Pour the spice mixture into a large, sealable plastic bag. Add pork and turn the bag to coat the pork with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.About 20 minutes before you are ready to grill, preheat a gas grill (with all burners lit) to 500F or build a fire in a charcoal grill and let it burn down to high heat (about 500F).If using a gas grill, turn off one burner (leaving 1 to 2 burners lit, depending on your grill). If using a charcoal grill, move the coals to one side. Remove the pork from the marinade (discard marinade). Place the pork on the unheated side of the grill rack. Close the lid and roast undisturbed for 45 minutes.Rotate the pork 180 degrees, cover and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 145F, 20 to 30 minutes more.
