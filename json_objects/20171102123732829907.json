Preheat oven to 300°F. Spread bread evenly over two rimmed baking sheets. Bake until bread cubes are completely dried, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven heat to 375°F.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat.

Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Adjust oven racks to lower middle and upper middle position.
