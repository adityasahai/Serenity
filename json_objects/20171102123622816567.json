Transfer chickpeas to a bowl and cover with water – the skin will float to the top; give the chickpeas a good stir to loosen any additional skin and repeat. Skim off the skins and discard them.Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor or blender. Add the carrots; process 30-40 seconds or until they form a thick paste. With the motor running, drizzle in the tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. Process until combined. Drizzle in the water and process 5 minutes, or until a smooth dip is formed. Add the olive oil and ras el hanout and pulse a few times to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired.To serve, transfer to a small dish and drizzle with additional olive oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the carrots to a small saucepan and cover with water.
