Starting with the top of the egg, wrap one end of the bacon around your egg, slightly overlapping as you wrap. Tuck end of bacon strip into the wrap. Carefully stretch bacon wrapping to make sure it fully covers the egg and is taut around the egg. You don't want the bacon to be loose because then it will separate from the egg when it's cooking. Repeat with remaining eggs. Roll wrapped egg lightly in flour. Then dip in whisked egg until fully coated. Allow egg drippings to drip off before rolling wrapped egg into bread crumbs. You don't want the excess egg yolk to drip into the bread crumbs because it will cause them to not stick to the egg. Roll wrapped egg in bread crumbs until fully coated. Place aside and repeat with remaining wrapped eggs. Add oil to pot being used for frying. Bring temperature of oil to about 300F. Place a few eggs into the pot and let eggs cook until bacon strips are cooked and coating is a golden brown. Rotatethe eggs a few times while frying so that they evenly cook on all sides. It should take about 3 minutes to cook each egg. To see if they are done, you can test one egg. Or you can usually see the bacon beneath the coating changing color. If you find that the outer coating is browning too fast, you can slightly reduce the temperature of your oil. Repeat until all eggs are done. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Gently stretch out a strip of bacon.
