top picks for Risotto. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434105,"title":"Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"Intense ruby red color.
