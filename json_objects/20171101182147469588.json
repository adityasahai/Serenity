A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry.

Prepare two 9\" cake pans by greasing well and flouring. Make sure the flour covers all of the pan and up the sides. Tap out the excess. Set aside.In the bowl of your stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment, or a large bowl with a hand mixer, mix together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt.In a separate bowl or large liquid measuring cup, lightly whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla extract. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix just until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl.With the mixer still running, slowly pour in the hot coffee until just incorporated. The batter will be very thin and liquidy!Divide the batter between two cake pans and bake in a 350F oven for 30-35 minutes, until a cake tester comes out with just a bit of moist crumb stuck to it. Cool for at least 20 minutes before depanning!Run a butter knife around the edges of the pan. Place a cooling rack over the cake pan and holding with both hands flip the cake pan over. Gently tap the bottom to ensure the cake has released from the pan. This cake is very moist and fragile. Take extra care!About 30 minutes before making the frosting, take the butter out of the refrigerator and cut it into chunks. You want the butter to be slightly softened but still cool.Set up a double boiler (a pot filled with water not all the way to the top) and bring the water to a simmer.In a very clean heatproof bowl (I use the bowl of my stand mixer) whisk together the egg whites and the sugar.Set the bowl over the double boiler, making sure the water is not touching the bottom of the bowl, and whisk while the mixture heats to 160F. You can check with a kitchen thermometer, or if you do not have one the mixture will become very liquid as the sugar melts and it should feel very smooth between your fingers. This will take about 5-7 minutes.Transfer the mixture to your stand mixer (or you can do it with a hand mixer but it will take much longer), whip at high speed with your whisk attachment to cool the mixture down. Continue whipping at high speed until stiff peaks are reached. The mixture will become very thick, glossy, and almost marshmallow like. This will take about 6-8 minutes of whipping.Once stiff peaks are reached, switch to your paddle attachment and add in 1 piece of butter at a time while mixing on medium-high speed. Let the piece of butter incorporate in before adding in the next one.Once all of the butter is added, continue whipping until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Your mixture will most likely start to look very curdled like cottage cheese before it gets very smooth. Don't worry, it will come together. Just keep whipping. If your butter was too warm and the mixture starts to look too thin, place the bowl in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, then whip again.For Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream- Swirl the slightly cooled melted chocolate over the buttercream and fold in.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 350F.
