White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try District 7 Estate Chardonnay.

Add the grated onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the bourbon whisky, the maple syrup, tomato paste, rosemary, salt and pepper. Whisk to combine. Bring to a low simmer. 2 Preheat oven to 350F. Place chicken wings in a bowl and pour half of the bourbon maple sauce over the wings, returning the remaining sauce to the stovetop. Toss the wings with the sauce to coat. Arrange the wings on an oiled, foil-lined baking pan, with space between each wing.3 Roast the wings at 350F for 20 minutes, then turn the wings over and roast them an additional 12- 15 minutes, or until nicely browned. Lower the heat or remove from oven if the wings start getting too dark.4 While the wings are roasting, simmer the remaining sauce until it thickens slightly and can coat the back of a spoon, then remove from heat.5 When wings are done, remove them to a bowl and toss with the remaining sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1Melt butter in a small saucepan on medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the grated onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the bourbon whisky, the maple syrup, tomato paste, rosemary, salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":10014037,"name":"bourbon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bourbon.jpg"},{"id":11887,"name":"tomato paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg"},{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rosemary.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Whisk to combine.
