The aromas are a complex mixture of licorice, blackberry, and a whisper of vanilla. The rich jammy taste has hints of licorice, herbs, spice and currants with a lingering finish of almond and anise. Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Ch√®vre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a blender, combine the apple, juice concentrate, ice cream topping and lemon juice; cover and process until blended.
