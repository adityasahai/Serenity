Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better.

It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":433977,"title":"Juve Y Camps Brut Nature Reserva de la Familia Cava","description":"Pale gold in color, this Cava has aromas of mature white peach, toasted bread and green tea with hints of lemon citrus and apricots.
