Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

Toss squash and cauliflower with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, cinnamon and cumin on a large baking sheet. Roast for 30 minutes, turning once, until tender and browned in spots. Meanwhile, toast walnuts in a small skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until fragrant and lightly browned. Place arugula in a large bowl. Whisk together the vinegar and molasses. Spoon the warm roasted vegetables over the arugula, drizzle with balsamic vinegar mixture and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Toss until the ingredients are coated and the arugula is slightly wilted. Stir in walnuts and pomegranate seeds and transfer to a serving bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature. Tip: The vegetables can be roasted in advance and re-warmed before assembling the salad.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425ºF.
