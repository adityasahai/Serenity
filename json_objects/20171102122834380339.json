Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Lightly grease an 8- by 8- inch square pan or a 9-inch pie plate and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a medium bowl with a handheld mixer, whip yolks with 3/4 cups sugar until pale and very fluffy. Slowly add butter and continue whipping until completely combined. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and poppy seeds. With mixer off, add dry mixture all at once and mix on medium-low speed to combine. Gradually add buttermilk and vanilla, continuing to mix on a medium-low speed until completely combined.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until foamy, then add 1 tablespoon sugar and whip until stiff and glossy. Gently whisk half of meringue into batter, then fold in other half with whisk. Scrape into prepared baking vessel and bake for 45-60 minutes, until lightly browned on top and still somewhat jiggly in the center, but not liquidy. Allow to cool for a couple minutes, then gently run a paring knife around edge of cake. Once cooled to room temperature, chill in refrigerator.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the Berries: Set a rack in center of oven, preheat to 400°F. In a baking dish at least 2 inches deep, combine berries with sugar, balsamic, lemon zest and vanilla, stirring to coat evenly. Roast for 20 minutes, gently shaking the pan every 5 minutes.
