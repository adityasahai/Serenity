Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Ricasoli Castello di Brolio Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":433641,"title":"Ricasoli Castello di Brolio Chianti Classico","description":"Dark ruby color, with lots of chocolate, berry and vanilla aromas, this is full-bodied and velvety, with lots of fruit and a long, succulent finish.

Dice shallots. Toss chicken breasts with some olive oil and season well with salt and pepper.2) Heat chicken stock in a large pot until it's simmering.3) In a large, high-sided pan, add a drizzle of olive oil over high heat. Once it's hot, add chicken breasts, skin side down. Sear for 5 minutes on each side.4) Transfer seared chicken breasts to an oven-safe dish and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes until they are cooked through.5) In the same pan that you used to sear the chicken, add some fresh olive oil and the shallots. Cook for a minute or two over medium high heat until shallots soften. Try to scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.6) Add rice and continue to cook for a minute or two. 7) Add white wine and continue to cook. At this point you should be able to easily scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.8) Once white wine is cooked off, ladle in warm chicken stock. Add about 3/4 cup of stock at a time and stir risotto as it cooks over medium heat.9) When pan is dry, ladle in more stock. Continue doing this until the risotto is soft but still has a tiny bite to it. This will probably take between 4-5 cups of stock and about 25-30 minutes.10) When risotto is desired texture, season with salt and pepper and stir in chopped persimmons.11) To remove pomegranate seeds, cut the pomegranate into quarters and break apart the quarters submerged in a bowl of water. The seeds will sink.12) Serve risotto with chicken and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat chicken stock in a large pot until it's simmering.3) In a large, high-sided pan, add a drizzle of olive oil over high heat.
