gel-like.  Stir in the coconut oil and extracts.Add the soymilk to a glass measuring cup and microwave for 15 seconds, or until warm.  Stir in the sucanat, then stir in the yeast.  Let sit ~10 minutes, the mixture should become foamy.In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the oat flour, brown rice flour, almond meal, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt.Stir the flax mixture into the measuring cup with the yeast, then pour this over the dry ingredients.  Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula until it forms a very soft dough.Sprinkle the oat flour onto a Silpat and LIGHTLY knead the dough just 3-4 times, or until it can form a ball.Spray a clean bowl with cooking spray and place the dough ball inside.  Cover with plastic wrap and let dough proof for 1 hour in a warm space (I used a warming drawer set to 88 degrees Fahrenheit)Sprinkle a tiny bit of oat flour onto the Silpat and place the dough on top (do not punch the dough down).  Sprinkle a tiny bit of oat flour over the dough and place another Silpat sheet on top.  Roll the dough out into a large rectangle.In a small bowl, stir together the coconut oil and butter extract.In another small bowl, stir together the erythritol and cinnamonBrush the oil mixture onto the dough rectangle, then sprinkle on the cinnamon-sugar mixture.Roll the dough, carefully, by lifting the Silpat up so that the dough curls onto itself.  Now just use your hands to continue rolling the dough.Put the dough \"log\" seam side down, and slice the log into 8.Grease an 8\" springform pan with cooking spray and arrange the slices inside.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm space (I set my warming drawer to 90 degrees)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for ~33 minutes, or until the surface is somewhat firm when tapped.  Remove the outside of the springform pan and let the cinnamon rolls cool.In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, soymilk and stevia.  Give it a taste and adjust as needed.Frost the cinnamon rolls!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, stir together the flax and water until thick and gel-like.
