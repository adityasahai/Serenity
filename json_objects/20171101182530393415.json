Add the pork chops to the brine and marinate for 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.Drain the pork chops and pat dry. Make a slice in the center of each pork chop to make a pocket and stuff with ¼ cup cheese and ¼ of the sage for each chop. Heat 2 large cast iron skillets over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to each skillet. Add 2 chops to each of the skillets and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, flip chops and add grapes to pan. Top each chop with 2 sage leaves and drizzle with olive oil and sea salt. Roast in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes depending on thickness or to 160 degrees. Remove chops and grapes from pan and move to a large plate reserving juices. Tent to keep warm.Put all of the juices into 1 pan over medium heat. Add chicken stock to the pan and scrape to pick up all of the flavorful crispy bits. Add butter and whisk to thicken sauce and add salt if needed. Serve pork chops with grapes and topped with sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, mix the water, sugar, salt, thyme, garlic, cloves and all-spice.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pork chops to the brine and marinate for 30-45 minutes.
