Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle) with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449340,"title":"St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle)","description":"This is a complex wine that reflects the heat of the afternoon sun, the cool, windy evenings, and the rustic soils of the McMinnville hills while retaining the dark beauty of its intense, ripe fruit. It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate. Ample ripe tannins balance with its acidity.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449340-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/st-innocent-momtazi-hill-pinot-noir-375ml-half-bottle-2014/167614"}]},"instructions":"<p>First, this recipe will start in the crockpot.Add short ribs to the crockpot. Pour maple syrup on top of them, along with garlic powder and salt. (I didn’t put any liquid in the crockpot because the fat will leak out and protect it from burning)Cook on low for 8-10 hours.When you wake up the next day, remove the pork ribs from the crockpot, shred them and pour some of the excess liquid from the crockpot over the shredded pork for extra flavor.Now make the tortillas. In a medium bowl, whisk together the tortilla ingredients until smooth.Place a large non stick skillet over medium-high heat, pour ingredients into the pan to create a pancake size tortilla. I would pour on the liquid, pick up the skillet to roll it around and flatten out the tortilla even more. Cook on both sides for just about a minute per side.Once all your tortillas are done (this made about 8-10 tortillas for me), place bacon on the skillet or oven to cook on both sides, cool then roughly chop.Then mix together the green chiles and hot sauce in a bowl, place in microwave for 1:30-2:00 minutes or until hot. And then chop the green chiles.Now load up each tortilla. Shredded pork, green chiles, bacon, then green onions. Then eat it.</p>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, this recipe will start in the crockpot.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add short ribs to the crockpot.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour maple syrup on top of them, along with garlic powder and salt.
