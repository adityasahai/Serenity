In a medium saucepan, combine sugars, cream, butter, water, and salt over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter is melted, the mixture is homogenous, and the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the pecans and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture reaches 238 degrees F on the thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat and stir vigorously and constantly for several minutes until the mixture thickens and cools slightly. I stirred for about 5 minutes, but use your judgment or drop a test praline on a baking sheet.Drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Cool completely on pan. When cooled, gently remove them from the parchment and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. They are delicate, so handle them gently at all steps in the storage process. I do not recommend freezing these.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.
