Have a cookie sheet ready.In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, and salt. Set aside.In a large bowl, beat together the butter, molasses, and egg until smooth (it will look curdled). Gradually beat in the flour mixture until well blended and a dough has formed. Stir in white chocolate chips.On a sheet of parchment paper, shape the dough into a 10x3 inch rectangle. Place the parchment paper with the dough onto the cookie sheet. Bake 20 minutes or until firm around the edges. Let cool on the cookie for 15 minutes (leave the oven on).After 15 minutes, lift the parchment paper and dough off of the tray onto a cutting board. Position the dough so the long side is horizontal. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch slices, being careful you don't break the pieces. Place the cookies back onto the cookie sheet, cut side down.Return to the oven and bake another 20 minutes or until crisp. Remove the cookies to a cooling rack and cool completely.When the cookies are ready to dip, place the baking squares in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at Power 4 in 15 second increments until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Stir in lemon zest. Dip one end of each cookie into chocolate. Let the chocolate harden before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F.
