Sherry, Port, and Moscato d'Asti. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Add the butter, then work it in with your fingers or a pastry blender, just until the mixture is crumbly. Some pieces will be the size of pebbles, others can be as large as your thumbnail. Leave some large and do not overwork. Stir 1/2 cup of the chopped pecans into the batter, saving the rest to sprinkle over the top.In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, maple syrup, maple flavoring, and eggs until smooth.Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, then add the wet ingredients all at once. Stir into the dry ingredients until a soft, moist dough forms. Divide the dough in half, then turn one half onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat the dough into a 5-inch circle that is about 3/4-inch thick, then with a knife or bench scraper, cut the dough into 6 wedges. Gently pull the wedges away from each other to separate them a little, leaving about 1/2-inch of space between the scones at their outer edges.Place the baking sheet in your freezer for 30 minutes. This will help the scones set, give them a better rise and texture.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Once the scones have chilled, remove them from the freezer and bake for 18 to 21 minutes, until they are light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. (The scones will need longer to bake the closer they are placed together, shorter if they are spread out and not touching.) The edges of the scones when pulled away from one another should appear dry and baked through and not feel wet or doughy.While the scones bake, prepare the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, maple syrup, maple or vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons milk. Add additional milk 1 teaspoon at a time as needed to make a pourable glaze. Drizzle over the warm scones, then top with the remaining chopped pecans. Enjoy immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the butter into small pieces (or for even easier incorporation, grate it with a box grater), then place it in the freezer while you prepare the other ingredients.In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the white whole wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and all spice.","ingredients":[{"id":93824,"name":"white whole wheat flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404778,"name":"box grater","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grater.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butter, then work it in with your fingers or a pastry blender, just until the mixture is crumbly.
