Add the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples have softened slightly (about 5 to 10 minutes).To make the oatmeal bars:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mist a 9-inch x 9-inch square baking pan with non-stick spray, and line it with parchment paper, allowing the excess to drape over the sides of the pan.Place the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine. Cut the butter into half-inch pieces, and use a pastry blender or clean hands to combine it with the dry ingredients (the mixture should be very crumbly, like streusel). Press about 2/3 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Top with the cooked and cooled apple filling, and drizzle with caramel sauce.Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top, leaving a few spaces for the caramel apple filling to peek through. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. Cool completely, then cut into bars. Garnish with more salted caramel sauce, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the apple filling:Melt the butter in a large skillet, over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":9003,"name":"apple","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
