Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"InstructionsBoil about three cups of water in a pan. Add the diced carrots, potatoes and eggplants — in that order with a three minute interval between additions. The carrots take longest to cook and the eggplants require the least cooking time so, by adding them to the boiling water in that order, chances are they will all cook at the same time.While the vegetables cook, heat the cooking oil in a shallow pan (a wok works best). Saute the garlic, onions, tomatoes, ginger, chilis and kaffir lime leaf until fragrant. Add the chicken strips, season with fish sauce and cook, stirring often, for four to five minutes which should be enough time to cook the chicken through.When the vegetables are done, drain them and refresh in cold water. Drain well.When the chicken is done, pour in the coconut cream and bring to a gentle boil. Add the cooked vegetables, cook just until reheated, then turn off the heat. Taste the sauce, add more fish sauce, if necessary.Transfer the chicken, vegetables and sauce to a shallow bowl, top with snipped cilantro, if you like, and serve hot. Best with rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil about three cups of water in a pan.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the diced carrots, potatoes and eggplants — in that order with a three minute interval between additions.
