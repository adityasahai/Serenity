A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent. A sweet entry leads to a rounded, lush, moderately full-bodied palate with a lengthy, flavorful finish.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428475-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/NV-Solera-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00HSME8OW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Wash, core and chop the apples into one inch cubes. Place the apple chunks in a 99 inch baking dish. They should be about two layers of apples deep. If they just cover the bottom either cut more apples or use a smaller dish. Squeeze the juice from half of the lemon over the apple chunks and toss to coat.In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir until they are well combined.Add the cold butter and mix until it is well incorporated. If you have a pastry cutter, this works best. If you dont have one, dont worry, just cut the butter into small chunks and then smear them into the dry mix using your hands (clean of course). Small chunks of butter are okay. See the photos below for what it should look like when it is mixed.Pour the crumble topping over the apples and bake for 45 minutes. Serve warm topped with a scoop of cold ice cream! DELICIOUS!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
