Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. One wine you could try is Gascon Malbec. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":437536,"title":"Gascon Malbec","description":"A classic expression of the grape, our Don Miguel Gascón Malbec opens with intense aromas of blackberry, plum and a hint of mocha. On the palate, dark fruit flavors are finely intertwined with notes of spice, licorice and chocolate for a magnificent full-bodied Malbec. Round tannins and a plush mouthfeel lead the way to a long, velvety finish.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437536-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gascon-malbec-2012/128058"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a bowl, combine the steak sauce and 2 tablespoons of coating mix.
