Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Cover and let stand 10 minutes, or until foamy.    Add eggs, yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt. Mix well.    Stir in flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough forms into a manageable ball.    Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 to 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until dough is soft and pliable, but not sticky. (You may need up to 5 cups flour.)    Place dough in a large, lightly greased bowl.    Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.    In a small bowl, toss dried fruit with confectioners' sugar.    Punch down dough, transfer to floured surface, and knead in the fruit.    Line cupcake tin with liners and divide dough evenly between them.    Cover loosely with dish towel, and let rise 30 minutes.    Brush with melted butter, if desired.    Bake for at 350 F for 25 minutes, or until cupcakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, combine yeast, water and sugar.
