A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is Sandeman Vintage Port. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 135 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430502,"title":"Sandeman Vintage Port","description":null,"price":"$135.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430502-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/1970-Sandeman-Vintage-Port-750/dp/B00FH1O8KK"}]},"instructions":"Heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until hot.
