Use a blender or immersion blender to pure the canned tomatoes along with their remaining juices. Add the pured tomatoes to the pot with the noodles, along with the six cups of chicken broth.If using a jalapeo pepper, add it to the pot whole (this gives a slight jalapeo flavor without too much heat). Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium high, and allow it to come to a boil. Let the pot simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the noodles are soft.Add lime juice and roughly chopped cilantro leaves to the finished soup just before serving (I used juice from half the lime, but adjust to your liking).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Dice the onion and mince the garlic so they are ready to go when needed.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the vegetable oil to a large soup pot.
