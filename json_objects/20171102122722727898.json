A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

It is very important to do this just before using.Whip egg whites while gradually adding 1 cup of the sugar. Then, little by little, add the rest of the sugar, whipping continuously until stiff peaks of meringue have formed.Mix the almond powder/powdered sugar mixture into the meringue, blending with a spatula until fully incorporated. The batter should be smooth and shiny. Divide the batter into two bowls and add  teaspoon of food coloring paste to one of the bowls, if you want two-colored shells.Using a piping bag fitted with a 10 mm round tip, fill the bag with meringue and carefully pipe 1-inch rounds onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 300 F for 12 minutes. Chocolate shells will take longer - about 14 minutes.While the shells are baking, simmer the cassis puree in a heavy medium-sized saucepan over med-high heat and soak the gelatin sheet in cold water for at least 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add gelatin sheet, and pour onto the white chocolate.Add cocoa butter and butter. Mix well.Remove the shells from the oven. Allow to cool slightly. Using your hands or a spatula, lift the shells from the parchment. Match the shells, one top down and one top up. Pipe a small amount of filling onto the upside-down shell and gently place the other shell on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 C)Sift almond powder with powdered sugar.
