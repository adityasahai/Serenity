A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Set aside.In a large bowl, add flour, sugar, orange zest, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well combined and set aside.Grate your  cup of frozen coconut oil into large bowl of dry ingredients.Using dough blender, work coconut oil into flour mixture until a grainy, meal texture forms.Pour in coconut milk, add in almond extract and gently combine, without overworking the dough. Then gently fold in chopped cranberries.Distribute dough evenly into mini scone pan (you should be able to fill each cavity evenly) and bake for 15-20 minutes. Check for doneness at 15 minutes by inserting toothpick in middle of scone, toothpick should come out with little to no batter. (My scones took 18 minutes.) Allow scones to cool in pan for 5 minutes.To make glaze, combine powdered sugar and start with 1 TBS or orange juice. Add more OJ a very small amount at a time, until desired consistency is reached.Transfer scones to cooling rack with baking sheet underneath. Drizzle glaze on scones, as much or as little as desired. Scones are best when served fresh.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F and grease scone panlightly with coconut oil.
