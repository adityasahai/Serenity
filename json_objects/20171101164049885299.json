White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Wash and pat dry chicken drumsticks.

You want a batter that is thick enough to coat the chicken, but not so thick that it cakes. Cover the drumsticks and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 475F/240C.Arrange the drumsticks directly on the upper rack (without a tray). Place a tray on the lower rack to catch the dripping oil. Roast in oven for about 15 minutes (or until crispy) and turn the drumsticks over to roast for another 15 minutes.While waiting for the chicken, combine the chili sauce ingredients in a large bowl and set aside.When chicken is cooked, add to sauce, add sesame seeds, toss to coat and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Wash and pat dry chicken drumsticks.
