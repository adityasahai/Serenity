Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose.
