If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

Add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked thorough. Add the bell pepper and onion and cook for another 3 minutes, until the vegetables are just softened.Add the corn, black beans, spinach, jalapenos, parsley, cumin, chili powder, salt and cayenne pepper. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Monterey Jack cheese.Wrap the tortillas in a clean, lightly moist cloth. Microwave on high for approximately 1 minute, until soft and pliable.Spoon equal amounts of the mixture into each tortilla. Fold in the ends, then roll tightly around the mixture. Secure with toothpicks, if needed. Place the egg rolls in a dish or on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, then refrigerate until cold. (I think they are best when they are refrigerated for 24 hours.)When ready to cook, place a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and preheat the oven to 350F.Heat about 1-inch of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet until about 350. Working in batches, cook the egg rolls until browned on each side, then transfer to the cooling rack. When all of the egg rolls are fried, transfer them to the oven to bake for about 15 minutes, until heated through.Alternately, you can just bake these - spray the tops with nonstick cooking spray then bake until warmed through and the tortillas are crispy, 20-25 minutes.Cut each egg roll in half and serve with the Avocado Ranch Dipping Sauce.Combine all of the ingredients and mix well. Keep refrigerated.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4513,"name":"vegetable oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked thorough.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the bell pepper and onion and cook for another 3 minutes, until the vegetables are just softened.","ingredients":[{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bell-pepper-orange.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the corn, black beans, spinach, jalapenos, parsley, cumin, chili powder, salt and cayenne pepper.
