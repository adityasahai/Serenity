A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Using a wooden spoon or electric mixer, blend the eggs and oils to form a smooth emulsion (like mayonnaise), then add the soy milk, vanilla, and sugar. Add the remaining dry ingredients and continue mixing until you have a smooth, thick frangipane batter (if it's dense and dry, add a little more milk to loosen the mixture).                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Grease 6 dessert or pudding molds (about 4 inches in diameter) using a little grape seed oil. Cover the insides of the molds with the quinoa, then tip them upside down to remove any excess.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer the frangipane to a pastry (piping) bag fitted with a plain tip (nozzle) and fill the molds, dividing the mixture evenly among them. Place 3 plum halves on top of the frangipane, then place the molds on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the plums look a little shriveled and the frangipane is golden and feels firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°F.
