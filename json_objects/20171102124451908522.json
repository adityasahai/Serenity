Set aside. In a separate small bowl, mix powdered sugar with half & half until smooth. You may have to stir in a little more half & half to get it to drizzling consistency.

Continue shaking the pot until the popcorn starts to pop. After a minute or two, the popping will slow right down and you'll have a pot full of popcorn.
