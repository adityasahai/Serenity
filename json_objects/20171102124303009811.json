Try pairing with Lambrusco Dolce, Late Harvest Riesling, and Vin Santo. These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it.

Place apple slices in a large bowl or pot. Pour boiling water directly over top. Cover and set aside at room temperature for ten minutes. Drain apples well and transfer to a large bowl. Allow to cool for 20 minutes, tossing occasionally. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with the dried fruit. Whisk together the sugar, starch, and spices and add to the apple mixture. Toss until well-coated. pour the contents of the bowl into the chilled pie shell. Cover with the top crust, either by cutting the chilled top crust into strips and weaving a lattice, or by covering the pie with the whole crust. Crimp the sides and chill the pie for 15 - 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            When ready to bake, brush the top with egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. If you've covered the pie with a whole top crust, cut slits in the top. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 375째F and bake for additional time: for non-lattice, approximately 40 minutes, for lattice, approximately 50, both rotating halfway through.
