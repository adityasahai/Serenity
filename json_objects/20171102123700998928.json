Try pairing with Cava, Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. The Poema Brut Cava with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Add onion and garlic and sauté until onion is fragrant and has caramelized, about 2 minutes.

Stir in diced tomatoes, chili powder, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika, and hot sauce. If you're sensitive to spicy food, start with half of the amount for each seasoning, then taste and add more as necessary. Reduce heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Add corn and black beans to chili and stir to combine. Simmer chili for at least 20 minutes (I usually let mine go longer - 30 minutes to an hour). Taste and season chili to taste. Ladle chili into bowls and garnish with shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of plain greek yogurt, and a sprinkle of chopped green onions.
