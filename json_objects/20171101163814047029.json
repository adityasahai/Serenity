Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Mix gently until evenly coated; set aside for about 30 minutes to allow the berries to macerate and release their juices while also allowing the sugar to dissolve.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with tin foil, for easier clean up. Coat 8 small ramekins or 4 large ramekins with coconut oil cooking spray and place them on the prepared baking sheet.Combine the white sugar with the extracted vanilla bean seeds with your fingers until well combined.Make the biscuit dough by combining the flour, vanilla sugar, baking powder, and salt together; whisk until well combined. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using your fingers until the mixture resembles course crumbs.Make a well in the center of the dough then add the milk and beaten egg. Mix until just combined.Stir the blackberries really well then divide them evenly between the ramekins.Drop spoonfuls of biscuit dough evenly on top of the berry filled ramekins.Place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool. Serve with ice cream, whipped cream, or plain! Enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Toss the blackberries with the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and corn starch.","ingredients":[{"id":9042,"name":"blackberries","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blackberries.jpg"},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix gently until evenly coated; set aside for about 30 minutes to allow the berries to macerate and release their juices while also allowing the sugar to dissolve.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
