Whisk well.Combine the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk well. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and combine well, but don't overmix. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes or so until you get your griddle/pan ready. Heat a non-stick ooking surface to medium heat and brush some oil or butter to coat. When the pancake batter has \"fluffed\" up and looks foamy, work in batches and scoop the batter onto the griddle/pan using a 1/4-cup measuring cup. Using the cup, flatten the batter out a bit because it won't flatten as much as regular pancake batter. Cook, flipping once, until pancakes are firm to the touch and both sides are golden brown. These will take longer to cook than regular pancakes, so if they get dark too quickly, lower the heat.Serve with butter and your favorite toppings. We liked a dollop of apple jelly. Because these pancakes are sweet, they really don't need a lot of extra sweetness.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl (flours through cloves).","ingredients":[{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk well.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Combine the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk well.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and combine well, but don't overmix.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes or so until you get your griddle/pan ready.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404779,"name":"griddle","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/griddle.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Heat a non-stick ooking surface to medium heat and brush some oil or butter to coat.
