A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Cool completely to room temperature then chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.When serving: unwrap each cheesecake. Stir pecans and caramel together in a small bowl. Melt chocolate according to package directions in a small bowl and then place the melted chocolate in a ziploc baggie with the tip cut off.
