All these red wines can handle the meaty, smokey flavor of brisket. If you're talking traditional Jewish brisket, you'll want to look for a kosher red wine. The Redbank Long Paddock Shiraz - Cabernet with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445833,"title":"Redbank Long Paddock Shiraz - Cabernet","description":"Blending Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected cool climatevineyards in the Ovens, King and Yarra Valleys of Victoria has enabled us toproduce a wine with a myriad of flavour sensations. Aromas of red berry andspicy aniseed are well integrated with the toasty oak as a result of 12 monthsageing on 2-3 year old American and French oak. Fruit flavour has beenoptimised through cool fermentation. Silky tannins and red berry fruits arelayered across the palate of this medium-bodied, distinctly fruit driven wine.This Long Paddock Shiraz Cabernet Sauvignon will developfavourably in the bottle over the next 2-4 years and can be enjoyed withhearty meat dishes or with char grilled steak or lamb at your next barbecue.","price":"$9.79","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445833-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/redbank-long-paddock-shiraz-cabernet-2001/55474"}]},"instructions":"In a bowl, add paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined.Sprinkle rub on to brisket, rub it in until the whole brisket is covered. You can refrigerate it for up to 24 hours if desired.If using a charcoal grill, heat the charcoal, once it turns to ash, push the charcoal to one side of the grill and place brisket over the opposite side (side without the charcoal) with fat side facing up. That way you are slowly cooking and smoking your brisket. Cook the brisket until tender enough to shred with your fingers; 5 hours, but it may take as long as 8 (cooking time will depend on the size of the brisket and heat of the grill). Note: You may have to add more coals. Just check on it every hour or so.Remove the brisket from the grill and let rest for 15 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and thinly slice it across the grain.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl, add paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, black pepper and cayenne pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"black pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix until thoroughly combined.Sprinkle rub on to brisket, rub it in until the whole brisket is covered.
