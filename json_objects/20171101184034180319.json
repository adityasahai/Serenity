Bring to a low simmer and cook for 1 hour, skimming the foam and scum regularly as they appear. After 1 hour, add the leek greens, carrot, fennel, garlic, onion, cloves, pepper, herbs, and salt. Add water to cover generously as needed, put the lid in place, and cook at a low simmer for another 3 hours. At this point, the meat should be fall-apart tender.Remove the meat and vegetables from the pot separately. Set the meat aside in a sealable container that you will place in the fridge once cool. (Some people throw away the vegetables, but I prefer to eat them that night, discarding any non-edible parts and eating them as is, or pureing them with a touch of strong mustard.) Strain the broth slowly into a large container, making sure you leave behind the sand-like, scummy bits at the bottom of the pot. Let cool on the counter then place in the fridge overnight.Put the potatoes in a medium pan and cover with cold water. Add salt, bring to a simmer, and cook, covered, until the potatoes are tender -- 10 to 15 minutes depending on their size. Drain and cut the potatoes in half lengthwise. Set aside.Remove the fat that has collected at the surface of the broth. Return to the cleaned pot, and add the new carrots, baby fennel, and shallots. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, until very tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning.First, serve bowls of the broth with a sprinkle of chives and good crusty bread.While that's being enjoyed, add to the pot the reserved meat and potatoes, and the peas, and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes, until the meat and potatoes are heated through and the peas are cooked.Serve the meat and vegetables in soup plates, ladling more broth over them, and place strong mustard and cornichons on the table.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, place the meat and cover generously with cold water.
