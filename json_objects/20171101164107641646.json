Since veggie burgers are usually lean, you'll want low to medium tannin wines. Pinot noir is a great choice. Another option is Spanish tempranillo, which pairs nicely with the earthy flavors you might have from beans, lentils, mushrooms, etc. The Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":454206,"title":"Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir","description":"The 2014 Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir is a blend of fruit from the John Sebastiano, Clos Pepe, Cargasacchi, and Lindley Vineyards. The actual blend is 64% John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir, 22% Clos Pepe, 9% Lindley, and 6% Cargasacchi. Clonally, this wine is a blend of 8 different clones which also provides for a wide range of flavors within one wine. The 2014 Pinot Noir Sta. Rita Hills should be a classic expression of the region, showing lots of spice, red fruit and dried soils aromas and flavors. Balanced, polished and elegant with plenty of fruit, it should certainly be an outstanding wine, and at the price, is an excellent value in Pinot Noir.","price":"$32.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/454206-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/siduri-sta-rita-hills-pinot-noir-2014/168102"}]},"instructions":"Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Generously grease a sheet of aluminum foil with oil.                            Bring barley and water to a boil in a saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.                            Mash black beans with a fork in a large bowl until thick and pasty. Stir barley, Cheddar cheese, mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper, parsley, eggs, garlic, salt, and black pepper into mashed black beans. Mix enough bread crumbs into bean mixture to form a sticky batter that holds together.                            Divide batter into 4 to 6 patties; place on prepared aluminum foil.                            Grill patties on the aluminum foil for about 8 minutes on each side.
