Puree until smooth. Alternatively, you can mince the garlic and ginger by hand and whisk everything together in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. Drizzle the eggplant with the olive oil and using clean hands, rub the skin and flesh until lightly greased. Arrange the eggplant cut-side up. Cook under the broiler until the top of the eggplant is golden brown and the flesh is soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and brush the cut-sides of the eggplant generously with the miso glaze. Return to the oven until caramelized, 2 minutes. Brush the tops of the eggplant again with the miso paste and return to the broiler, rotating the pan for even cooking. Serve immediately garnished with the scallions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the broiler","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small food processor, combine the miso, vinegar, water, ginger, and garlic.
