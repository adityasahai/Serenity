Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay. The nose is full of citrus, green apple and pear with floral overtones.

Add oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for about 6 minutes per side, or until cooked through. This will depend on the thickness of your chicken breasts. Remove from pan and keep warm. Add the shallots to the pan and cook for about 1 minute. Add the beer, soy sauce, mustard and honey to the skillet and bring to a boil, making sure to scrape up any browned bits. Cook until the liquid has reduced to ½ cup, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet and coat with sauce. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately, spooning additional sauce over the chicken.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add oil to the pan and swirl to coat.
