Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

When light and fluffy add the two egg yolks, one at a time. Add the lemon extract and grated rind followed by the sifted flour and salt. Get the dough in a ball, flatten it a little bit, cover in plastic foil and refrigerate for about 1 hour or until easy to handle. When chilled place the dough on a lightly floured working area and roll it out to 1/4 inch thickness. With a cookie cutter, cut cookies and place them on cookie baking sheet with parchment paper. When all the cookies are cut (about 2 dozen depending on the size and thickness) place the baking sheets in the fridge while waiting for the oven to heat to 350F. When the oven reaches 350F bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. Leave to cool completely on the cookie sheet before removing. The cookies last up to a week in a air-tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium size mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar.
