Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 43 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Mix salt, sugar and 5 spice together.

Place in a small baking dish and cover with plastic wrap ( or wrap the whole roast in plastic wrap) refrigerate overnight (or for at least 2 hours). Bake in a 250F oven for 6 hours, uncovered, basting with the flavorful pan juices once every couple hours. Pull it from the oven and let it cool a bit. ( Alternatively, if using a slow cooker, cook for 4-5 hours on high, or 7 hours on low, adding a  cup water to the bottom first) Shred the pork with two forks.

Garnish with avocado slice ( optional) and fresh cilantro and lime wedges.Notes: To get the pork crispy, saute in a skillet, letting it brown up, right before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix salt, sugar and 5 spice together.
