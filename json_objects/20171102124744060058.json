A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Crease the parchment paper along each edge to stay put. Spread half of the almonds, evenly spaced, across the pan. Set aside.Melt the chocolate with the shortening, if using, in either a double-boiler over gently simmering water, or in a heat-proof glass bowl in the microwave. If using a microwave, heat in bursts of 30 seconds on medium power, stirring well and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula after each increment. Once the chocolate is completely melted and smooth, stir in the vanilla extract, if using.Slowly pour into the sheet pan over the almonds, and use an offset spatula to gently spread into an even, smooth layer. Top with the remaining almonds, and gently press into the melted chocolate. Sprinkle with sea salt. Firmly tap the bottom of the sheet pan against the counter to release any air bubbles. Refrigerate for 20-25 minutes to set, then let sit at room temperature for about an hour to completely set.Once completely set and hardened, lift the bark out of the pan using the parchment paper, and use a large knife to cut the bark into pieces. Alternatively, simply use your fingers (I like to cover the bark with parchment paper so I don't leave fingerprints) to break the chocolate into pieces. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to two weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a 9-by-13-inch rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper, leaving a few inches of overlap on each side.
