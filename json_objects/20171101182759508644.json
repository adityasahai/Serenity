Beer might seem like the natural pick for German food, but German riesling pairs wonderfully with seafood and schnitzel, while a German red like Dornfelder goes well with beef and game meat. One wine you could try is Eroica Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":434655,"title":"Eroica Riesling","description":"This Eroica shows the crisp acidity of the 2007 vintage, which was the best acidity holding year in the past five years. The wine delivers mandarin orange and sweet lime aromas and flavors with subtle mineral notes. The cooler September, along with selecting fruit from higher elevation and cooler sites, contributed to the mouth-watering acidity balanced by beautiful Washington Riesling fruit.An amazing pairing with sweet, flavorful Dungeness crab.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434655-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/eroica-riesling-2007/96190"}]},"instructions":"In a bowl, combine almonds, the zest of one lemon and basil.
