White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is NV Mindbender Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

Drain it and set aside.In a large skillet heat the olive oil and add the chicken breasts to it. Cook the chicken until it's no longer pink, so it should be white, then add the chopped onion and garlic to the skillet. Cook for another 3 minutes, until the onion softens and the chicken is cooked through.Wash and drain the black beans. Add the black beans to the skillet, along with the enchilada sauce, chicken broth, heavy cream, salsa and half of the cheese. Stir and let it cook until the pasta cooks. It will absorb most of the sauce.Sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the top and place under the broiler for a couple minutes just until the cheese gets golden. Garnish with parsley and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by boiling the pasta only for about 3 to 5 minutes, you do not want it cooked through.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain it and set aside.In a large skillet heat the olive oil and add the chicken breasts to it.
