Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet. Fresh and fruity, very clean and crisp.Tiamo Pinot Grigio pairs well with a wide array of lighter cuisine, especially fish/shellfish, poultry, pastas in cream sauce and softer cheeses. It's also an ideal aperitif.","price":"$8.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438682-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/tiamo-pinot-grigio-2008/98091"}]},"instructions":"In a small skillet over medium heat toast the sesame seeds about 5 minutes stirring often.In a shallow dish combine 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds with the garlic, oil, vinegar, and soy sauce. Thread 4 shrimp onto each skewer, piercing each at the head and tail, and place in the marinade, coat well and allow them to marinate 10  minutes.On a separate shallow dish sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds and coat the shrimp with them.Lightly grease a large skillet and place over medium-high heat. Sear the skewered shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until opaque. Alternately you can grill them or broil them for the same amount of time. If using a skillet pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp and cook 3-4 minutes. If grilling or broiling: simmer the marinade 3-4 minutes in a small saucepan. Plate and pour the sauce over the shrimp or serve on the side as a dipping sauce. Serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small skillet over medium heat toast the sesame seeds about 5 minutes stirring often.In a shallow dish combine 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds with the garlic, oil, vinegar, and soy sauce.
