French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 103 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431104,"title":"Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend","description":"Raspberry and cherry with notes of violets lift from the glass and mingle with soft spice and toasted oak on the nose. Smooth, lush flavors of blackberry, black cherry, and cassis wrap around a core of full, yet soft, structured tannins. Cedar notes with light touches of spice fold into lingering cherry and berry flavors surrounded by a sea of rich chocolate on the palate.","price":"$103.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431104-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Terra-Blanca-Mountain-Bordeaux-Blend/dp/B00O83YLPK"}]},"instructions":"Directions:                                     Preheat oven to 325 degrees.In a heavy bottomed pot over medium heat combine the cream and vanilla bean. Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.In a separate bowl whisk together the egg yolks and half of the sugar.  Add a little of the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking continually. Continue adding until the egg mixture is about the same temperature as the remaining milk. This is called tempering. Add the milk/egg mixture back to the pot with the remaining milk.  Place back over medium heat, continually whisking until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and strain.Place 6 ramekins into a shallow pan that can hold water. Fill each ramekin almost to the top with the custard.Bring the pan to the oven and then fill with water so that the water comes about half way up the sides of the ramekins.Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the custard is set in the center. Remove from the oven and remove ramekins from the water bath. Cool in the refrigerator until ready to serve.Using the remaining sugar, coat the tops of each of the ramekins with a thin coating. Shake off the excess. Using your kitchen torch, brown the sugar, being careful to stop torching once the sugar has turned an amber color. You can also achieve this (with less dramatic effect) by placing the ramekins under the broiler of your oven.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees.In a heavy bottomed pot over medium heat combine the cream and vanilla bean.
