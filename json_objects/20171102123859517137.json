Add the remaining coconut milk 1 tbs at a time, folding the crumbly mixture until it forms a cohesive dough.Form a dough ball and then flatten it into a disc.  Wrap it with plastic wrap and refrigerate 20 minutes.Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.Roll the disc of dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper until 1/8\" thick.  Use this cookie cutter and slide a thin/sharp pie server under the dough to transfer it to the baking sheet, line them on the sheet 2\" apart.Bake ~10 minutes, or until edges are slightly golden, then carefully slide the wafers onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely (they will be somewhat soft right out of the oven, but will harden as they cool).In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the peanut butter and coconut milk.Stir in the protein powder (should be thick like buttercream).
