Try pairing with Ice Wine, Moscato, and Vin Santo. Vin santo is typically sweet with notes of baking spices and nuts, so it pairs really well with pumpkin spiced desserts. A good sparkling Moscato would work too, and if you feel like splurging, an ice wine. One wine you could try is Nacina Riesling Ice Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 40 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428908,"title":"Nacina Riesling Ice Wine","description":"Nacina, Wein der Eisbox, made from Tondre' Vineyards late harvest Riesling and frozen post harvest is our tech savvy answer to global warming.

Prepare crust: Combine first 3 ingredients and 1 Tablespoon sugar in a bowl; cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal and is pale yellow (about 3 1/2 minutes). Sprinkle ice water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, over surface; toss with a fork until flour is moistened and mixture is crumbly (do not form a ball.)  Add more flour, if needed -- if it appears to be too sticky.2. Gently press mixture into a 4-inch circle on a sheet of heavy-duty plastic wrap, and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap; chill 15 minutes. Roll dough, still covered, to a 13-inch circle; place in freezer 5 minutes or until wrap can be removed easily. Remove bottom sheet. Fit dough into a 9-inch pie plate coated with cooking spray; remove top sheet. Fold edges under and flute; set aside. *Don't let the dough sit in the freezer too long or it will \"break\" when you try to fit it into the plate.3. Prepare filling:  Combine filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; beat at medium speed of an electric mixer until well blended. Pour into pastry shell. Bake in a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.5. Slice and serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Remove bottom sheet. Fit dough into a 9-inch pie plate coated with cooking spray; remove top sheet.
