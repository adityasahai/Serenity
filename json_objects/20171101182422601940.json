Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F Undercook pasta (the package were calling for 11 minutes and I cooked them for 7 minutes) In a large bowl, combine tomato sauce, parmesan, garlic, salt and pepper.  Drain pasta and let cool a bit.  Add pasta to bowl and mix well until pasta is totally coated.  Pour pasta in a 9x13 baking dish, add shredded cheese on top and bake for about 20 minutes.
