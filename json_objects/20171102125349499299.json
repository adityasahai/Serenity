Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Pour about 1.5 litres cold water into a wok or large pan that will take a bamboo steamer on top. Add all the herbs and spices, bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for half an hour or so.Meanwhile, set aside about 24 large basil leaves from the bunch. Put half the remaining bunch (including stalks) into a pan with the shallots and Noilly Prat. Boil gently until the liquid is reduced to around 2 tbsp and the shallots are soft, about 3 minutes. Pour in the stock and boil gently until reduced by half. Add the two creams and remaining bunch of basil to the pan. Simmer until the sauce is reduced by half and has the consistency of pouring cream, about 3-4 minutes. While its boiling, add a squeeze of lemon juice (if not boiling, the sauce will split).In the meantime, shred 8 of the reserved large basil leaves and put into a heatproof bowl or small pan. When the sauce has reduced down, check the seasoning and strain the sauce through a fine sieve onto the basil shreds. Set aside while you put the dish together.Separate the bok choi leaves. Trim off the stalks from the larger leaves (reserve the stalks) and arrange these leaves on the base of the steamer, like a daisy. When youre ready to cook the salmon, bring the aromatic water back to the boil. Scatter half the remaining 16 basil leaves over the bok choi. Press the rest of the basil on top of each salmon fillet. Season the leaves and drizzle with some oil, then sit the salmon on the leaves and drizzle with more oil and some lemon juice.Put the bok choi stalks, smaller leaves and hearts into a large bowl. Season with salt, drizzle with more olive oil (about 4 tbsp), 2 tbsp of the balsamic vinegar and a little more lemon juice, toss together and leave to wilt for about 3 minutes.Sit the steamer basket in the wok or over the pan and cover, then turn the heat to medium. Cook for 3 minutes. Take everything off the heat and leave to stand, still covered, for 4-5 minutes for fish that is lightly cooked inside and 6-7 minutes if you like the flesh firm.While the salmon is standing, heat a large non-stick frying pan until you can feel a strong heat rising  it should be 'stinking' hot. Toss in the wilted bok choi and immediately start to stir fry over a high heat for a couple of minutes until completely wilted and lightly caramelised. Drizzle in a little more olive oil and another 2 tbsp vinegar to deglaze. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Gently reheat the velout.Divide the stir-fried bok choi between four warmed plates. Sit a salmon fillet on top, pour around the basil velout and sit some of the steamed bok choi leaves on top of each salmon fillet to garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour about 1.5 litres cold water into a wok or large pan that will take a bamboo steamer on top.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"},{"id":404666,"name":"wok","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/wok.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add all the herbs and spices, bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for half an hour or so.Meanwhile, set aside about 24 large basil leaves from the bunch.
