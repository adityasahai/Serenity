Try pairing with Cava, Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. One wine you could try is Campo Viejo Cava Brut rosé. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":468840,"title":"Campo Viejo Cava Brut Rose","description":"A bright sparkling pink color.

Saute, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeno and continue cooking for 3 minutes.Transfer the onion-garlic-jalapeno mixture to your slow cooker (I used this 6-quart slow cooker), along with the rest of the ingredients for the chili. Stir well and cover. Cook on low for 8 hours.Use a fork to fish out the chicken breasts and place them on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken, then place it back in the crock pot. If time allows, let the chicken soak in the chili for at least 1 hour (overnight is better) for maximum flavor. Serve heaping bowls of chili with your favorite toppings.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the olive oil over medium-high and add the onion.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Saute, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and jalapeno and continue cooking for 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11979,"name":"jalapeno pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer the onion-garlic-jalapeno mixture to your slow cooker (I used this 6-quart slow cooker), along with the rest of the ingredients for the chili.
