Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Add the oat flour, baking soda, and salt to the dough; mix until combined. Stir in the remaining oats. Cover and chill 30 minutes.Heat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with silpats or parchment paper.Use a medium cookie scoop to divide the dough into two tablespoon portions; roll into a ball, then flatten between your palms. Spoon 1 teaspoon of Nutella onto the center of the dough. Bring the edges up around the Nutella to form the dough back into a ball, making sure the Nutella is completely inside (patch with a little bit of extra dough, if needed). Repeat with remaining dough. Place the dough balls onto the prepared cookie sheets, 2 inches apart.Bake 18 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges and set in the middle. Let cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy; beat in the egg and vanilla.Use a blender or food processor to grind  cups of oats into a fine flour (I love my Vitamix S30 for this).","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":8120,"name":"oats","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the oat flour, baking soda, and salt to the dough; mix until combined.
