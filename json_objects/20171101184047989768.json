Set aside.Combine breadcrumbs, flour, and spices in another bowl and set aside.Combine hot sauce, margarine, vinegar, garlic powder and salt in a small saucepan. Heat on medium-low, whisking frequently, until margarine is melted and mixture is bubbling. Remove from heat and set aside.Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside.Heat 1 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onions and cook until softened and most liquid is released, about five minutes.Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and add the garlic (meanwhile, wipe down the skillet so you can use the same one for frying). Pulse until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add sage, thyme, parsley, salt, pepper and water and process into a relatively smooth paste. Add vital wheat gluten and process until mixture is smooth and doughy (about 45 seconds to 1 minute). If mixture seems too wet, add 1 Tbsp of vital wheat gluten.Roll the dough into a cylinder about 16 inches long. Cut into 1-inch pieces and shape into tube-like pieces, then flatten slightly (the pieces will swell a little when you cook them).Place the wings on the lined baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes per side. Remove from oven.Heat about 1.5-2 inches oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat (if you have a thermometer, you're going for 350-375. If you don't, flick a stray breadcrumb into the oil - if it bubbles immediately and browns within seconds, you're good to go). Turn the heat under the wing sauce back to low.Dip each wing into the milk mixture, then roll in the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring each is thoroughly coated. Fry for 45-60 seconds, then flip and fry for another 30-45 seconds, until coating is browned.Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a 250 degree oven. When all the wings are cooked, toss with the buffalo sauce. Serve with celery, carrots, and your favorite blue cheese (this is my favorite vegan version)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine milk and vinegar in a small bowl and stir.
