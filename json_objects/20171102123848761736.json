Once melted, remove from heat and slowly add in sweetened condensed milk, peanut butter and vanilla extract, stirring with a large spatula until mixed. The chocolate will be thick. Mixture is going to get super thick but slowly stir and just fold the chocolate mixture over until combined. Use the spatula or a large spoon to spread the chocolate into the pan. It will be very thick, just try and spread as evenly as you can. Place in the fridge for 10 minutes to set.Melt the dark chocolate in the microwave on 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until melted and smooth. This takes me about 1 minute and 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the fridge. Pour 3/4 of the dark chocolate over the fudge. Using the back of a spoon, spread it evenly over the top of the fudge. Immediately cover it with the chopped Reese's and chopped Hershey's kisses. Take the remaining dulce de leche and melt in the microwave for 30 seconds. Let cool for three minutes and then drizzle over the top of the candy. Add the potato chips on top of top of the candy (crushing them if you would like). Now grab the remaining melted chocolate and drizzle over the potato chips. Let set in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.Use a sharp knife to cut the fudge into 16 squares.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a 8×8 pan with wax or parchment paper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add semi-sweet chocolate, 3/4 of the can of dulch de leche (leaving 1/2 cup in the can) to a double boiler, and melt completely.
