Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

In a bowl, cream together butter and sugar until fluffy; beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture (batter will be very firm). Shape into 48 balls, about 1 inch round, and place on ungreased baking sheets. Push one cherry halfway into each ball. (I used a small melon baller to press an indent into the cookie first since the dough is so firm.)2. For frosting, melt chocolate chips and milk in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; add cherry juice and stir until smooth. Spoon 1 teaspoon of frosting over each cherry, making sure to cover cherry completely. The frosting will spread a bit during baking, but not much, so make sure the cherries are covered before baking.3. Bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes. Cool on wire racks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl, cream together butter and sugar until fluffy; beat in egg and vanilla.","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture (batter will be very firm).
