Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small bowl, beat cream cheese and horseradish until smooth.
