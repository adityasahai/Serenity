Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Cut four tomatoes into quarters and place in a food processor.
