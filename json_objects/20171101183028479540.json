spray.In a large bowl, combine butter, oil and sugar and whisk until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes.Add in eggs, vanilla, buttermilk, and cinnamon and whisk until smooth.Add flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, and whisk just until combined. Stir in apples. Batter will be thick (see notes).Make the streusel: Combine butter, flour, oats, brown sugar and cinnamon until combined. It will hold together if you press it between your fingers, but I prefer my streusel this way! It will get nice and crunchy as it bakes.Spoon batter into a large disposable piping bag or freezer bag (optional method  see notes). Cut off the end of the bag so your opening is about -3/4 wide (big enough for the apples to get through). Pipe batter once around each doughnut hole  the batter shouldnt quite fill the hole as theyll expand and rise.Press crumbles of streusel into the top of the doughnut (my tops were pretty much completely covered!).Bake for 7-8 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes before removing from the doughnut pan to cool completely.Make the glaze:Combine butter, maple syrup and powdered sugar with a whisk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled doughnuts and let set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and grease your doughnut pans with butter or non-stick spray.In a large bowl, combine butter, oil and sugar and whisk until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":425.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add in eggs, vanilla, buttermilk, and cinnamon and whisk until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]}]},{"name":"Let cool 10 minutes before removing from the doughnut pan to cool completely.Make the glaze","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine butter, maple syrup and powdered sugar with a whisk until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drizzle over cooled doughnuts and let set.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Add flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, and whisk just until combined.
