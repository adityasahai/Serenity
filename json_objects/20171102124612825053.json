Place the zest, orange juice and all the other ingredients in a medium saucepan; Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn the heat down and continue cooking until most of the cranberries have popped, about 5  10 minutes. You dont really have to stir, but Im sure you wont be able to resist the urge to do that from time to time.Turn off the heat and let the sauce cool down a little then transfer to the fridge to chill completely, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. The sauce will be much thicker, and tastier, when cold.In a medium saucepan, add all the ingredients for the brine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes.Turn off the heat and cool to room temperature.Place turkey breast in brine (use a plastic, stainless steel or other non reactive container or you could also use a resealable plastic bag) and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.Remove turkey breast from brine and rinse well under cold water; pat dry. Slice your turkey breast open. To do that, place the blade of your knife parallel to your cutting board, put your hand flat on top of the breast and carefully slice down the middle almost all the way to the end. You want to stop about  of the way through. Place your now flat turkey breast on your cutting board and lay the apple slices so that they form a single layer but still overlap slightly. Don't go all the way to the edge; you want to leave about one inch all around. Spread cranberry sauce over apple slices and top with goat cheese. Close and tie your turkey breast with butcher's twine and leave it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Preheat your oven to 350F. Brush a non-stick pan with a little bit of olive oil and place to heat over medium-high heat. When pan is hot enough, sear the turkey breast on all sides and transfer to an oven safe dish; cover with aluminum foil. Roast in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until juices run clear. Take the turkey breast out of the oven and loosen the aluminum foil to form a tent. Let the meat rest for 15-20 minutes, then slice and serve with more cranberry sauce on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Zest the oranges first, then squeeze out their juice.","ingredients":[{"id":1019016,"name":"juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-juice.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the zest, orange juice and all the other ingredients in a medium saucepan; Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
