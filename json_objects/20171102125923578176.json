A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. Place in your freezer until ready to use.Once the ice cream is completely softened (think slightly softer than soft serve) scrape into a large mixing bowl. In another mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, pumpkin spice and the ¼ C granulated sugar. Pour the pumpkin puree mixture into the ice cream and mix well. The ice cream should now be light orange. Pour into the prepared pie crust.Soften the Nutella by placing it in a microwave safe bowl and then microwaving for 5-10 seconds. Using a spoon, spoon ½ of it over top of the ice cream and then use a knife to swirl it. Repeat with the remaining Nutella. Freeze for 8 hours or over night.Once the pie is frozen, top with the Cool Whip by using a rubber spatula. Sprinkle with the butterscotch chips and then drizzle with caramel sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the melted butter, 3 tbsp granulated sugar and graham cracker crumbs and mix until all of the crumbs are moist.
