Add the sweet potatoes to a rimmed baking sheet and then add in the olive oil and garlic.  Toss to combine and then spread in an even layer.  Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until tender.  Remove from the oven and set aside.Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Meanwhile, set a small skillet over medium heat.  Add the butter chunks to the skillet.  Let the butter melt and then continue to cook, whisking frequently, until it begins to brown (this takes several minutes).  You should see brown bits on the bottom of the pan.  Once you see those bits, turn off the heat and continue to whisk constantly for about 30 seconds, until the butter is golden brown.  Be careful not to burn the butter - those bits can turn black quickly.  Transfer the browned butter to a small bowl (make sure you get all those caramel bits in the pan!).   Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Set two pieces of the naan on each sheet.  Generously brush each piece with some the browned butter.  Top each with the mozzarella, the sweet potatoes and then drop small dollops of the ricotta over the tops.  Bake for about 10 to 13 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese is nice and melted, rotating the pans once during baking.  During the last 2 to 3 minutes of baking, top each flatbread with some of the spinach.  Slice and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the sweet potatoes to a rimmed baking sheet and then add in the olive oil and garlic.
