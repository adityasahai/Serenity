A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.Mix together the crust ingredients and press into your preferred pans. You can press the crust just into the bottom, or up the sides of the pan, too – baker’s choice. Set crusts aside.Combine cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand-mixer (or in a large bowl if using a hand-mixer) and cream together until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, fully incorporating each before adding the next. Make sure to scrape down the bowl in between each egg. Add heavy cream & vanilla and blend until smooth and creamy.Evenly pour batter into prepared crusts and tap the pans on the counter a few times to bring all air bubbles to the surface.Bake 35 to 45 minutes, until it is almost done – this can be hard to judge, but you’re looking for the cake to hold together, but still have a lot of jiggle to it in the center. You don’t want them to be completely firm at this stage. Close the oven door, turn the heat off, and let rest in the cooling oven for one hour. This lets the cakes finish cooking and cool down gently enough so that they won’t crack on the top. After one hour, remove cheesecakes from oven. Let them finish cooling on the counter, and then cover and put in the fridge to chill. Cook the chocolate chips and heavy cream in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until smooth and warm, stirring occasionally. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before using.Once the cheesecakes are fully chilled, pull from refrigerator and drizzle chocolate ganache over the top. Stack fresh raspberries on top, if desired. Serve immediately or return to refrigerator until ready.Adapted from: Abbey’s Infamous Cheesecake by Abbey T.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
