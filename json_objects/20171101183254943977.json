Try pairing with Sangiovese, Barbera Wine, and Shiraz. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Selvapiana Chianti Rufina with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
