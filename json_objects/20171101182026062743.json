Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"To make the zoodles:Slice the zucchini on a mandolin using a 5mm julienne blade.Place the zoodles in a large strainer and place the strainer over top of a large bowl.Sprinkle the zoodles generously with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes, stiring every so often.While the zoodles get ready, preheat your oven to 450 degrees and cut any visible fat off your pork tenderloin.Rub the pork with ½ Tbsp of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.Heat the remaining 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large, oven proof pan on medium/high heat.Sear the pork until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.Pop the whole pan into the oven and cook until the pork reaches 145-150 degrees when a thermometer is inserted into the thickest part, about 10-15 minutes.Once cooked, remove the pork from the oven, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.To make the pistachio pesto:Place the pistachios in a food processor and process until roughly chopped.Add in the basil, cilantro, lemon zest and Parmesan cheese. Process until well chopped and combines.With the machine on, stream in the water and 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Add more oil if your prefer a runnier pesto. *Squeeze out any extra moisture from the zoodles and transfer to a large bowl.Stir the pesto sauce into the zoodles until well combined.Divide between 4 plates and top with sliced pork and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.Devour!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the zoodles:Slice the zucchini on a mandolin using a 5mm julienne blade.","ingredients":[{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"},{"id":10111477,"name":"zucchini noodles","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zoodles.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the zoodles in a large strainer and place the strainer over top of a large bowl.Sprinkle the zoodles generously with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes, stiring every so often.While the zoodles get ready, preheat your oven to 450 degrees and cut any visible fat off your pork tenderloin.Rub the pork with ½ Tbsp of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":10218,"name":"pork tenderloin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pork-tenderloin-raw.png"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":10111477,"name":"zucchini noodles","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zoodles.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405600,"name":"sieve","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/strainer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}}]},{"name":"Heat the remaining 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large, oven proof pan on medium/high heat.Sear the pork until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.Pop the whole pan into the oven and cook until the pork reaches 145-150 degrees when a thermometer is inserted into the thickest part, about 10-15 minutes.Once cooked, remove the pork from the oven, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.To make the pistachio pesto","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the pistachios in a food processor and process until roughly chopped.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add in the basil, cilantro, lemon zest and Parmesan cheese.
