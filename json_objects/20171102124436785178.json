Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Pasta: You can use dried pasta for this (just cook until al dente and reserve some pasta water) but I think it's better with fresh. Click on the link above to prepare my homemade pasta. You won't need to use the pasta cutter once the pasta sheets have been rolled and dried on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes. Just lightly flour the sheets (so they don't stick), roll them up and cut them finger-width, about 10 mm. Toss in a bit more flour until you're ready to use them.To cook the Pasta: Boil a pot of water, salt generously then add the pasta. If you're using fresh pasta, they will take only about 3-4 minutes to cook. Reserve some of the pasta water, drain and set aside. (Ideally, you'll want to add the fresh pasta to the boiling water after you've started cooking the rest of the dish so they don't sit too long.)To prepare the mushrooms: Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of very hot water (just under boiling) for about 20 minutes to rehydrate. Reserve the water but strain out any dirt or particles from the mushrooms with a sieve. Roughly chop the fresh mushroomsTo cook: In a pan large enough to accommodate the pasta, heat  cup of the oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the fresh mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes then add the garlic and some salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and 1-2 tablespoons of the chopped fresh parsley. If the mushrooms have absorbed too much oil, add another tablespoon or two.Add the mushroom liquid and turn up the heat to medium-high. Cook until the most of the liquid has reduced, about 2 minutes. Feel free to add more oil at this point if you feel it needs it. I like to add it throughout the cooking time. Add  cup of the pasta water, taste for seasoning. Add the chili flakes or chill sauce if using then add a splash of cream just to thicken the sauce a little (2-3 tablespoons). Toss in the pasta. You can add the lemon juice here if you like. Add more pasta water and/or oil if too dry for your taste. Sprinkle the rest of the chopped parsley, plate and serve. Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pasta: You can use dried pasta for this (just cook until al dente and reserve some pasta water) but I think it's better with fresh.
