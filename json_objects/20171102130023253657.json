Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Nieto Senetiner Malbec with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440601,"title":"Nieto Senetiner Malbec","description":"Wine of well defined profile, deep red color and great intensity. Aromas of small red fruits and plums dominate the nose; the vanilla scents from the oak barrel add elegance.

Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the onion and celery until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.                            Place the cooked onion and celery in a large bowl with the ground turkey, stuffing mix, and eggs; mix to thoroughly combine. Form the mixture into 16 patties. Unlike hamburger, these patties will not change shape while cooking, so make them even in size.                            Grill the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place each patty on a hamburger bun, and top with cranberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream cheese to serve.
