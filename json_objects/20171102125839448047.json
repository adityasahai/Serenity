Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Once oil heats, add in garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add in the red pepper flakes. Cook for 30 seconds and then add in the tomatoes, oregano and season with more salt and pepper. I like my tomatoes crushed, so I took a potato smasher and smashed the tomato chunks - you can do this with a fork!Let the mixture cook for about 10-15 minutes or longer, until the sauce reduces and most of the juices are gone. Then, add in the kale and zucchini pasta and cook until the kale is wilted and the zucchini softens. When you add in the kale and zucchini, put a medium skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Once skillet heats, add in shrimp and season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes and then flip on the other side for another 1-2 minutes or until shrimp is cooked through and opaque.Pour the pasta mixture into your dish, and top with the shrimp and feta.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in olive oil.
