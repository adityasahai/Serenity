If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

You can use an electric mixer if you prefer to make it more creamy. My mom does not measure out the Cool Whip and uses anywhere from 8-16 ounces, so it truly just depends on your preference. There may be a bit of extra texture in the dip (aside from the coconut) due to the instant pudding - it will dissolve as it sits.You can obviously leave out the rum if serving this to children. My mom never did and we turned out fine. (That's subjective.)This needs to be refrigerated but thanks to the Cool Whip, can sustain heat and room temperatures for hours on end at a party. Ew gross. And amazing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine all ingredients in a giant bowl and mix, mix, mix!
