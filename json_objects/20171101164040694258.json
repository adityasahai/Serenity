mushroom caps with a damp paper towel to remove any dirt. Remove the stems from the mushrooms, chop finely, and set aside. Drizzle a little olive oil in your hand and lightly rub the mushroom caps with the oil and place on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the insides of the mushroom caps with a little kosher salt.Heat a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes or until completely browned. Add the chopped mushroom stems and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the green onions and the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the panko crumbs and stir to combine evenly with all the other ingredients. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream cheese until evenly distributed. Stir in the chunks of Fontina, Parmesan cheese, parsley and season with kosher salt and pepper.Fill each mushroom with a heaping portion of the sausage mixture. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the sausage begins to brown and the mushrooms start to release moisture.While the mushrooms are baking, prepare the hollandaise sauce (recipe below).Remove the mushrooms from the oven and add a dollop of hollandaise to each mushroom cap. Garnish with more chopped green onion and watch the crowd fight for more than just one!Melt the butter over the stove or in a microwave safe container and set aside.Place the egg yolks, dry mustard, lemon juice, and Tabasco in a blender and mix for 30 seconds. Slowly add the hot butter in a steady stream to the blender and blend until thickened, about 30 more seconds. The hollandaise will thicken as it cools, so serve at your preference.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.Carefully brush the outsides of the mushroom caps with a damp paper towel to remove any dirt.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/paper-towels.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the stems from the mushrooms, chop finely, and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Drizzle a little olive oil in your hand and lightly rub the mushroom caps with the oil and place on the baking sheet.
