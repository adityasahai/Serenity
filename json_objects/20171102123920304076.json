Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle) with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate. Ample ripe tannins balance with its acidity.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449340-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/st-innocent-momtazi-hill-pinot-noir-375ml-half-bottle-2014/167614"}]},"instructions":"Dressing: In small bowl or glass jar with tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients and season with freshly ground pepper.
