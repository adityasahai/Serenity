If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Lightly coat mini muffin pan with cooking spray.Place the cauliflower florets in the top of a steam or a steamer basket. Steam until tender when pierced with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes.Transfer the florets to a kitchen towel and let cool for 5 minutes. Wrap the towel around the florets and squeeze out any remaining moisture. Transfer the florets to a cutting board.Chop the cauliflower until it resembles grains of rice. This can also be done in a food processor, but be sure not to over process. Transfer to a medium bowl.Stir the hummus into the cauliflower until combined.Add the egg, egg white, breadcrumbs, feta cheese, parsley, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir until combined.Using 1  tablespoons per bite (I used a cookie scoop for portioning), transfer the mixture to the mini muffin pan. Using the back of a small spoon, press down gently to condense the mixture.Bake until the bites are set and the undersides of the bites are golden brown, about 20 minutes.Gently loosen the bites with a small knife and transfer to a plate. Serve hot with the yogurt dip, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
