This dark, bold Cabernet has solid tannins and jammy fruit, with aromas of black cherry, blackberry, freshly-cracked black peppercorn, violet and charred notes. On the palate, flavors of dense black fruit compote and currant followed by a trio of clove, spice and earth, lead to a generous, lingering finish.Try pairing this Cabernet with grilled lamb skewers, strong cheeses or a spaghetti Bolognese.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442127-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gnarly-head-cabernet-sauvignon-2012/129675"}]},"instructions":"Place mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with warm water; let stand for 30 minutes.
