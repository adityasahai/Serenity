Pour the milk over the breadcrumbs in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the meatloaf mix, 1 cup of the cheese, 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce, the salt, pepper, green onions, garlic and egg and mix with your hands until just combined.                          Divide and shape the mixture into 6 balls and arrange the balls in a 6-cup nonstick muffin pan. Place the muffin pan on a rimmed baking sheet and brush the remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce on top of the meat.                          Bake for 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through cooking. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Continue to bake until the meatloaf muffins are cooked through to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 5 minutes more; the interior muffins may take a little longer to cook. Cool 5 minutes in the pan.
