Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. You could try Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Whisk in olive oil slowly until you have an almost creamy consistency. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.                            Cut endive heads crosswise into rings. Remove the hard end of the stems and discard. Rinse in a colander, shaking to separate the slices into rings. Set aside to drain.                            In a large dry skillet over medium heat, toast the pine nuts. Stir constantly so that they do not burn. Once the pine nuts are golden, throw in the endive rings. Once it has warmed just slightly, pour in the dressing and toss to coat. Reduce the heat slightly if the endive is wilting too quickly. You want to maintain some crispness and texture.                            If you have guests to impress, throw in the parsley. The sharp green flecks will brighten the dish and enhance the flavour, but the salad is in no way lacking without. Serve immediately. It is best served directly from the pan to the plate.  If is put in a bowl, the dressing will settle at the bottom and be difficult to toss again without damaging the endive.
