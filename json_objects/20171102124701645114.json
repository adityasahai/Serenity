A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Soft legs cling to the glass and the nose conjures up nougat and caramel with a hint of blackberry. A smooth mouth-feel gives way to a burst of spice while hints of licorice and blackberry are followed by a finish of almonds. Enjoy this delightful port with pâtés, chèvre and nutty cheeses.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/469322-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Merlot-375mL/dp/B00A6ER878"}]},"instructions":"Mix all ingredients together and serve immediately.Is that all?
