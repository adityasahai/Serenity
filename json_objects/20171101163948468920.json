Tracesix large hearts(roughly 3 inches tall x 2.5 in wide) on a large sheet of parchment paper. Place parchment paper on a large baking sheet--pencil side facing down.Place the egg whites in the bowl (clean and free of any grease) of stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk over low speed for 1-2 minutes, or until egg whites are foamy. Increase speed to medium and continue to whisk for an additional 1-2 minutes. Slowly start sprinkling in the granulated sugar, while continuing to whisk at medium speed. Increase speed to high and whisk until meringue reaches a stiff peak (10 to 12 additional minutes).Gently fold in the cocoa powder with a spatula. Place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip.Pipe a thin layer (roughly 1/2\" thick) of meringue--filling the entire heart--to form the base of the cup. Carefully trace the edges of the heartfour times with piped meringue to form the sides of the heart meringue cups. It should be relatively tall, about 1.5 inches tall at least. Repeat until all of the meringue cups are formed.Immediately (and carefully) place the meringue in the oven and bake for 1 hour and 45minutes, or until the meringue is dry. Once baked, turn off the oven and allow meringues to dry in the warm oven for an additional 15 to 20minutes. Meringue should be crispy, hard, and not sticky. If the meringue is wet or sticky (which can depend on humidity levels), allow them to bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.Remove the meringue cups from the parchment paper and set aside. Allow the meringue to cool completely.Assembly:Place the cold cream, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer (or medium sized bowl). Using the whisk attachment, or a hand-held mixer, whip the cream until it reaches soft peaks.Do notoverheat.Fill the meringue cups with dollops of whipped cream, top with mixed berries, and garnish with shaved semisweet chocolate (optional).
