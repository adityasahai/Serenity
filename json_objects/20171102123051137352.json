works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"Preheat a broiler with a rack set 4 inches from the heating element. Line a baking sheet with foil.                          Whisk together 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, the sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add the salmon and coat on all sides. Marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes, turning the salmon periodically. Place the salmon skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Broil until just cooked through, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet. Cool enough to handle, then flake off bite-size pieces of salmon with a fork.                          Combine 6 cups water, the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, the ginger and scallion whites in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the ginger and scallions with a slotted spoon and discard. Whisk in the miso. Add the mushrooms and bok choy, and cook until the mushrooms are tender and the bok choy leaves wilt, about 2 minutes.                          Mound 1 cup of the hot rice into four bowls. Ladle the vegetables and miso broth around the rice. Top each with some flaked salmon, sliced scallion greens, seaweed and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds. Serve with sambal on the side if using.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a broiler with a rack set 4 inches from the heating element.
