Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

It's also an ideal aperitif.","price":"$8.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438682-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/tiamo-pinot-grigio-2008/98091"}]},"instructions":"Score the skin of the duck, place them skin-side down in a cold heavy-based frying pan. Turn the heat to high and let the duck slowly warm; this will render the fat from the skin, so you get a better texture and flavour, about 10 mins.Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to the boil and add a dash of the oyster sauce to it. Boil the bok choi for 2 mins until wilted, drain and set aside. Reduce the heat under the duck, cook for a few more mins, then remove from the pan. When cool enough to handle slice the duck thinly. Pour 1 tbsp of the fat from the duck into a wok with the oil and place over a high heat. Throw the duck in to the hot fat and let it cook for 3 mins until coloured. Add the bok choi and oyster sauce, stir well, simmer for 2 mins and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Score the skin of the duck, place them skin-side down in a cold heavy-based frying pan.
