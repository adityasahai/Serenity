Until risen and bubbly.  In mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, 2 eggs, butter and proofed yeast mixture. Start mixing on low speed and add in remaining 1/4 cup warm milk.  Once fully blended switch to dough hook or knead on counter by hand for about 5 minutes. Until smooth.  Let dough rise in bowl for 30 minutes, in a warm location, covered with a damp cloth.  While dough is rising, cover 8 half pint (8 ounce) jars with aluminum foil, set aside.  Make an egg wash by combine egg and 1 teaspoon of water, whisking until well combined.  Combine sugar and cinnamon to make cinnamon sugar.  Once dough is risen, turn out onto counter, roll into a thick log and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope, about 2 to 2 1/2 feet long.  Rub each foil covered jar with cold butter then wrap 1 rope of dough around each jar. Dough should go around the jar almost 3 times.  Spread cinnamon sugar out on a baking tray or 9x13 pan (something big enough to roll your pastry covered jar in). Brush pastry with egg wash and then roll pastry in cinnamon sugar to coat, pressing down as you roll. Place pastry covered jar on a parchment covered or lightly greased baking sheet, open end down. Make sure to space jars 2-3 inches apart.  Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully slide warm pastry off jars.  Best eaten while still warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/4 warm milk in a small bowl, stir just to moisten and let sit for 10 minutes.
