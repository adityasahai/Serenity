White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Remove wing tips and freeze for stock or other recipes.  Remove winglet from drumette by holding wing like a V with drum portion completely vertical and cutting straight down at base of drumette. The joint will separate without cutting the bone.  Or if you prefer whole wings, skip this step and just move to next step. Place wing pieces into a large bowl. Pour the Spice Rub over the chicken wings.  Toss to coat and place into a gallon zip lock bag and refrigerate overnight.  Save the remaining Spice Rub for Chicken for other recipes.Prepare your Bourbon Barbecue Sauce while the chicken marinates.  When ready to cook the wings, heat the sauce and hold.Heat your grill to medium high heat.  Using a vegetable oil-soaked paper towel, oil the grill grates.  Place the chicken wings in a single layer over the heat and cook seven to ten minutes per side with the grill cover closed.  Check after four or five minutes and flip if cooking too quickly.  Once fully cooked, remove wings from the grill and place in a large bowl.  Pour one cup of Bourbon Barbecue Sauce over wings and toss to coat.  Place the wings back on the grill and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side just to brown and caramelize the sauce – being careful not to burn the sauce. Serve immediately.  Additional Bourbon Barbecue Sauce may be served on the side for dipping.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove wing tips and freeze for stock or other recipes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove winglet from drumette by holding wing like a V with drum portion completely vertical and cutting straight down at base of drumette.
