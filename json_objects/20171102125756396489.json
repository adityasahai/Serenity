Then beat in the egg and then mix in the flour, sugar and salt. Add the melted butter until combined. Leave for 10 minutes and then knead the sultanas in.Lightly oil the work surface and then lightly knead the dough. Return the dough to the bowl and leave for 10 minutes then knead once or twice more at 10 minute intervals. Cover and leave for about an hour or until it has risen by around a half.Just before the rising time is up melt the butter for the filling and add the cinnamon and sugar to dissolve. Then leave to cool.Flour your work surface and roll the dough out to a large rectangle about 1cm thick. Then brush the melted butter mixture evenly over the dough. Roll the dough up tightly from the long side and cut into approximately 3 cm wheels. Place close together in a 20cm square cake tin, the base covered with baking paper and the sides greased. Cover and leave somewhere warm for 30 minutes or until almost doubled in size.Half way through the rising time pre-heat the oven to 220C. After the rising time bake for 15 minutes.Towards the end of the baking time make up the sugar syrup and once you remove the scrolls from the oven brush the sugar syrup over to give a glossy look.Allow the scrolls 15 minutes to cool. In this time make the icing. Slowly add the icing sugar to the water and vanilla extract until you have a thick icing that you can drizzle. Spoon or drizzle the icing over the scrolls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk.
