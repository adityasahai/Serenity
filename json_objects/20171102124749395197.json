A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners. Set aside.Make the cupcakes: Whisk the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Add the milk and vanilla, whisking until combined. Set aside.Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.  Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir gently until combined.  The batter will have a few lumps. Fold in the apple.Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters of the way full with batter. Bake for 21–23 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out clean when done. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before frosting.Make the frosting: While the cupcakes are cooling, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Once melted, add brown sugar and heavy cream. Stir constantly over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Add salt. Allow to bubble for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to slightly cool. With an electric mixer, beat in powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, until you reach desired consistency. I used 2 cups. Frost cooled cupcakes and adorn with store-bought caramel sauce and sprinkles, if desired.Cupcakes stay fresh at room temperature in an airtight container for 5 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Preheat the oven to 350°F.
