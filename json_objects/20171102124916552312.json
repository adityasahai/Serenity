rosé are my top picks for Tacos. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 42 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage. Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose. The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.","price":"$41.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438237-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gary-farrell-russian-river-pinot-noir-2007/102829"}]},"instructions":"Combine the lentils and water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still have a little bite. Drain any excess water and set aside.Preheat oven to 425 degress. Toss together the cauliflower, olive oil, salt, pepper, and dill, until all pieces are evenly coated. Bake for 20-25 minutes, removing from the oven to stir a few times, until tender and browned.Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, then add the shallot and cook for a few minutes, until translucent. Pour in the lentils and buffalo sauce. Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the lentils have mostly absorbed the buffalo sauce. Taste and add a sprinkle of cayenne, if desired.For the sauce, combine the yogurt, sour cream, salt, pepper, vinegar, and basil in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth. Add the kale and olive oil, and again blend until smooth. Taste and adjust salt/pepper to your liking.Wrap the tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 10 seconds, until slightly warm. Top each tortilla with about ¼ cup lentils, and a few cauliflower florets. Drizzle with sauce, and eat up! Serves 5-6 people, with 2 tacos each.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the lentils and water.
