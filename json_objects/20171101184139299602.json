works really well with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Rombauer Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447938,"title":"Rombauer Merlot","description":"Enticing and lively red color; beautifully aromatic with black cherry and ripe plum. On the palate a purity of blackcurrant, cedar and mint flavors blend together seamlessly.
