Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Stir for a few seconds, turn off the heat then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for 10 minutes. This will help preserve the color of the scallions. Take it out of the refrigerator and wait until it reaches room temperature before using.To prepare the dressing: combine all the ingredients and let sit for a few minutes for the flavors to meld.To prepare the steak: Heat a tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet. Place the steak seasoned with salt and pepper (and paprika) and cook for about 4 minutes on each side. My filet was over 1-inch thick and to serve it rare as pictured above, I partially covered the skillet. (When I prepare more than one steak, I like to sear them in a skillet as described here then finish them in the oven). Transfer the filet to a plate and wait a few minutes before slicing it.To assemble the salad: Arrange the greens on two plates then top with slices of beef. Garnish with kumquat slices and drizzle each plate with 1-2 tablespoons of the dressing. Serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To prepare the scallion oil heat the oil over medium heat then add the scallions.
