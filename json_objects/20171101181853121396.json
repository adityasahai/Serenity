Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Rinse the chicken and trim any excess fat flaps. Pat the bird dry with paper towels and sit, breast-side up on a rack inside a baking sheet. If you dont have a rack, wind a long piece of tin foil into a circle and seat the chicken on top of it. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the coconut oil, Chinese five spice and salt. Gently separate the skin from the chicken and rub the coconut oil mixture underneath. If the bird is very cold, the oil might seize up  dont worry about it. Lightly brush the outside of the bird with canola oil. Roast the chicken in the oven until the juices run clear, 60 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and rest the chicken until cool enough to touch.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the tamari, vinegar, ginger, garlic, and honey. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 10 minutes.Brush the chicken with the sauce and carve, thinly slicing the breast on an angle. Arrange the chicken on a platter and serve alongside the remaining glaze, kimchi pickles, butter lettuce, and scallions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Rinse the chicken and trim any excess fat flaps.
