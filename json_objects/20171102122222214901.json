Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.

Add the asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and lemon zest and continue cooking another 2 to 5 minutes, depending on your desired level of done-ness (I like my asparagus al dente). Sprinkle with sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste.Heat a medium-sized non-stick skillet to medium-high and add the butter and olive oil. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with sea salt and place on the hot skillet, skin-side up. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes (depending on thickness of fish), and carefully flip to the other side. Cook 3 minutes, add the garlic and lemon juice and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, until salmon is cooked through but still moist.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat olive oil and butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11011,"name":"asparagus","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asparagus.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and lemon zest and continue cooking another 2 to 5 minutes, depending on your desired level of done-ness (I like my asparagus al dente).
