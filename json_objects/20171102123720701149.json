Unwrap the brie and lay the cheese on a flat surface.  Discard the wrapper but set the bottom part of the container aside.Using a serrated knife, slice the brie rind off the top of the brie, taking care not to cut off too much of the cheese with the rind.  Place brie wheel back into the bottom part of the container and set the container on a piece of parchment, then set everything on a baking sheet or in a glass or aluminum (disposable) pie plate.  At this point, you can let the brie sit at room temperature for up to 30 minutes before baking - this will reduce the baking time so plan accordingly.In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally until brown bits start to form on the bottom of the pan.  Once the butter turns very slightly golden brown, add the squash and thyme (be careful - the thyme may spit at you in the pan).  Toss to coat and lightly saute for just a minute or two.  Spread the apple butter over the brie, top with the squash, thyme, and brown butter.Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the brie is melted and the squash has started to sink into the brie.  Slide the brie (still in the bottom container) using the parchment paper to a serving platter.  Serve immediately with crackers, toasted bread, sliced salami, or sliced soprassata (or all of the above).  Wrap any leftover cheese (hah!) tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 F.
