After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Mark West Black Label Monterey County Pinot Noir with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437001,"title":"Mark West Black Label Monterey County Pinot Noir","description":"The deepest, darkest, smoothest Pinot in Mark West's collection, with notes of black cherries, plums, mocha, vanilla, and caramel.Pairs perfectly with grilled lamb chops, gourmet flatbread pizza, and pulled pork sandwiches.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437001-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/mark-west-black-label-monterey-county-pinot-noir-2016/235737"}]},"instructions":"In a bowl whisk together garlic, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic, 1/4 cup red wine, 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary, salt and pepper.Place flat iron steak in a resealable plastic bag.
