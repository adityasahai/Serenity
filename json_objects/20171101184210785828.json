Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 375F Lightly grease a muffin pan with coconut or olive oil; set aside. Add all the ingredients except chicken and hard boiled eggs to the bowl of your food processor and process until it reaches the consistency of a thick paste, about 1 minute. Add the chicken and process on pulse until the meat is finely ground and all the ingredients are completely incorporated. Divide into 8 equal portions. Lay a piece of plastic film onto your work surface and place one portion of meat right in the center. Flatten the meat into a roughly half inch thick circle, then place an egg in the middle. Gently slide your hand under the plastic wrap and lift the whole thing up. Use the plastic film to shape the meat around the egg until the egg is completely wrapped, then finish “shaping” it with your bare hands. Place the finished egg in the muffin pan and repeat process with the remaining eggs and meat. Place the Scotch eggs in the oven and set the timer for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, take the pan out of the oven and carefully tilt it over the sink to drain the liquid that has accumulated in the cups. Place the pan back in the oven and continue cooking the eggs for an additional 5 minutes, or until nice and golden in coloration. Remove eggs from pan and set to \"dry out\" and cool on a cooling rack for about 5 minutes. Serve warm or cold, with a side of greens.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375F Lightly grease a muffin pan with coconut or olive oil; set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404671,"name":"muffin tray","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-tray.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add all the ingredients except chicken and hard boiled eggs to the bowl of your food processor and process until it reaches the consistency of a thick paste, about 1 minute.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the chicken and process on pulse until the meat is finely ground and all the ingredients are completely incorporated.
