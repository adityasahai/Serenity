Save some of the grated mozzarella cheese, and cilantro to sprinkle over the top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake covered for 1 hour.Remove the aluminum foil and sprinkle the rest of the cheese all over the quinoa and bake uncovered for another 30 minutes or until the quinoa is completely cooked. You may want to use your broiler for 2 minutes to brown the top a bit when the quinoa is done cooking. I normally don't do this step though. When the quinoa is done sprinkle the rest of the cilantro over the top and serve while still warm.NOTE: You can make your own chipotle sauce by placing chipotles in adobo sauce in your blender with some tomato juice. If you use this make sure you add a bit less of it because it will be more concentrated. 1/2 cup of the sauce, depending on how spicy you want your quinoa, should be sufficient. If you choose to make your own chipotle sauce add an extra 1/3 cup water to the quinoa.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 350F.In a 9 x 13 rectangular baking dish, about 5qt capacity as the quinoa will expand and need more room, add all of the ingredients and mix through.
