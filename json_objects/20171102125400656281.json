Place bread in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, in 2 layers if necessary. Pour the egg mixture over the bread. Let sit until the compote is done, occasionally turning and pressing gently to help the bread soak up all the egg mixture.Preheat oven to 200F.Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until melted and hot.
