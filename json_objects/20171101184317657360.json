These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. One wine you could try is Campo Viejo Cava Brut rosé. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":468840,"title":"Campo Viejo Cava Brut Rose","description":"A bright sparkling pink color.

Start with the onion, add to the pot as you go. Once they are all in, add the turkey and begin to brown.While the turkey is cooking start to chop the tomatoes and add them in 1-2 at a time. Once the tomatoes are all added, move on to the peppers. Once everything is in the pot salt it a little and continue to cook.This is when I remember I had 2 cayenne peppers from last week’s share.They dried a bit but still good! I added both which gave the dish a nice heat without being overbearing.Chop up the cayenne and add it to the pot. By this time all the juices should be escaping the veggies giving you a nice broth base to the chili.Stir in the spices and beans and once you get a boil, lower to as simmer.I ate a bowl right away because I couldn’t help myself but it was better after simmering for about 2 hours.I purposefully wanted to thicken it up to use it for a quesadilla filling for dinner.He never suspected a thing and the only semi-negative comment I got was that they were a little hot. A glass of water cured that. He happily ate a whole chili filled quesadilla with spinach, cheese and bell peppers on a whole grain tortilla. So did I. :)The recipe yielded just over 6 cups so I’ll calculate it as a 6 – 1 cup servings which is what’s pictured above.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and spray with non-stick cooking spray.Now, there’s a lot to chop so I did it in batches while cooking.
