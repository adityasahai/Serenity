White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay.
