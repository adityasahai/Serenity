Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 F degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a small sauce pan, whisk all the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.Cut the chicken breasts into long thin strips. Place the chicken in a bowl and pour about a cup of buttermilk over the chicken. Get 3 shallow plates ready. Fill one with flour, one with remaining buttermilk and last with breadcrumbs. Line them up like an assembly line, chicken, flour, buttermilk, breadcrumbs. Season the flour and the breadcrumbs generously with salt and pepper.Dredge each chicken finger through flour, then buttermilk, and lastly through breadcrumbs. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with all chicken fingers.Bake them for about 30 to 45 minutes until they start to brown and chicken is cooked through. Cut one in half if needed to check for doneness.If you wish to fry these, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet. Fry chicken on both sides for about 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown.While chicken is baking, bring the sauce to a boil over medium high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a medium and cook until sauce reduces by half and thickens.Generously drizzle sauce over chicken fingers. Garnish with chopped green onions, if preferred.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.
