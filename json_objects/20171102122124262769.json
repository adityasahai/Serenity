Try pairing with Cava, Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. You could try Bohigas Brut Reserva Cava. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440298,"title":"Bohigas Brut Reserva Cava","description":"Pale yellow colour. Constant and small bubble. Foam of great persistence. Very fruity aromas, especially of white fruit (acid apple and pear) on shades of peel of citrics and white flowers. In the background, some spicy notes owed to ageing (cinnamon) and cookies. It is a well-structured \"cava\" in the mouth. Well picked up over its acidity that tenses it overall from beginning to end. The bubble lends a creamy feeling, and it gives volume and softness to the structure that returns acidity and widens the aromas of white fruits and spices that are repeated in the mouth. Its balanced end harmonizes its acidity, and leaves a memory of freshness and volume owing to its light sugar content","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440298-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bohigas-brut-reserva-cava/131248"}]},"instructions":"Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat.Drain off the fat.In a large pot, combine the beef plus all the remaining ingredients, and bring to a simmer over low heat.Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, for 2 to 3 hours.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":10023572,"name":"ground beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fresh-ground-beef.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain off the fat.In a large pot, combine the beef plus all the remaining ingredients, and bring to a simmer over low heat.Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, for 2 to 3 hours.","ingredients":[{"id":23572,"name":"beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
