Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 8 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439141,"title":"Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio","description":"It has a straw yellow color. On the nose it has floral notes with hint of dry hay and fresh lemon. On the palate it has a soft citrus flavor with hints of crusty bread and acacia honey.

When hot, add the olive oil, followed by onion and garlic. Cook onion and garlic, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, not brown, about 5 minutes. If they are browning, turn the heat down. When softened, add lemon juice and zest. Cook for a couple minutes, until the juices have reduced and thickened. Add noodles and salmon. Cook until warmed through, about 2-3 more minutes. Add parsley, and cook for 1minute more. Make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed, serve, and enjoy. A piece of bread, perhaps even homemade Italian, is the perfect compliment.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat.
