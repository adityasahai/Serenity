Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Sancerre, and Vermentino. With buttery shrimp scampi, a crisp acidic white wine will refresh the palate. Any of these wines will do the trick. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438867,"title":"Chateau Ste.

September harvest conditions were ideal with very warm, clear days and cool nights.\"Fresh pear, honeydew melon and mandarin orange aromas and flavors combine with chamomile tea, honeysuckle and assorted floral characteristics...\" according to winemaker, Erik Olsen.

Drain the pasta, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta water.In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil together over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion, cooking until the onion is translucent.  If using UNCOOKED shrimp, add the shrimp, and cook for about 2 minutes.  Flip, and cook for about 1 minute on the other side.  Remove the shrimp from the pan to a plate, and set aside.Add the lemon juice, white wine, and red pepper flakes to the skillet, heating over medium heat until it has reduced slightly.  Add the shrimp back into the pan, along with the cooked pasta and about 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water, and reduce the heat to a simmer for about 5 minutes (if you used PRECOOKED shrimp, add it now).Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add the other 1/2 cup of reserved pasta water to thin if desired (I only used 1/2 cup).  Remove the tails from the shrimp before serving (you don't have to do this, but it makes it a lot easier on the people eating it!).Serve sprinkled with freshly grated parmesan and more red pepper flakes.  I also recommend garlic bread and a glass of wine.  ;)  Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, until al dente.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain the pasta, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta water.In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil together over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and onion, cooking until the onion is translucent.
