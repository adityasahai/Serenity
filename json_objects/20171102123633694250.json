(preferably metal) and whisk like crazy until it holds peaks, about 2-3 minutes if you are good.2) In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, syrup, and cinnamon in a small bowl.3) Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Add your bread to a few baking sheets and bake the bread for about 10 minutes until they are fairly crispy. You don't want them browned really, but just dry.4) Whisk together eggs, half and half, cinnamon, vanilla, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a large baking dish. Whisk well.5) Once your bread is dried (and cooled) set it in the custard mixture and let them soak up as much custard as possible. 10 seconds per side should do the trick. They should get soggy, but still hold together if you have good bread.6) Let these pieces rest for a few minutes on a cooling rack. This will let the excess custard mixture drip off and also give the bread time to really absorb the mixture that is there. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.7) IN a baking sheet, pour 1/4 Cup vegetable oil. Swirl it around and put it in the oven to heat up for about 4 minutes. Once the oil is hot, lay your french toast right on the pan. I was able to fit 6 pieces per pan. It will sizzle and hiss and that's good. Then back in the oven for 8 minutes or until the bottom sides are well browned.8) Take them out and flip them over. Once you flip the pieces then sprinkle about 1 Tablespoon of the brown sugar topping on each piece. Don't worry about lumps or if it is uneven. When it melts it will spread out.9) Back in the oven for another 6 minutes and you should have lovely oven baked french toast. Keep a close eye on it the second time around as the brown sugar can go from perfect to burned in about 30 seconds.10) Let it cool for a few minutes before eating. I served these with the whipped cream, syrup and some fresh strawberries.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add your bread to a few baking sheets and bake the bread for about 10 minutes until they are fairly crispy.
