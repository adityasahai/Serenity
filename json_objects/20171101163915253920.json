Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Ruffino Prosecco. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447373,"title":"Ruffino Prosecco","description":"Ruffino Prosecco has been produced from grapes grown in the hilly area of Valdobbiadene, which is the most historically vocated region for the production of Prosecco.Bright straw yellow with fine bubbles. The bouquet is fragrant and intensely fruity. It shows clean notes of apples, pears and citrus, accompanied by slight hints of hawthorn, wisteria and elder. Crisp, clean and delicate with fine bubble caressing. Intense sensations of apples and peaches drive a pleasant aftertaste, that is reminiscent of fruity and floral aromas.Ideal as an aperitif; it is very versatile as a food companion. Ruffino Prosecco perfectly matches with pizza, fish and shellfish dishes as well as white meat dishes.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-prosecco/111308"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large skillet coated with cooking spray, saute onion and green pepper.
