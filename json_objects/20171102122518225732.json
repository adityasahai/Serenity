A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Once mixture reaches a boil, reduce heat slightly and allow to gently boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat, add in peanut butter, chocolate chips and vanilla, stir mixture until chocolate chips have completely melted. Pour in Rice Krispies Cereal and toss mixture to evenly coat. Pour mixture into a buttered 8x8 (or 9x9) baking dish and gently spread and press into an even layer. Allow to cool until just warm to the touch then evenly distribute diced Reese's Peanut Butter Cups over top and lightly press them onto the coated cereal. Enjoy warm, with ooey gooey melted chocolate topping (my favorite, I love melted candy bars though =) or cover and refrigerate until chocolate has set, then remove from refrigerator and rest about 10 minutes at room temperature and cut into squares. Store in an airtight container.Recipe Source: Sweet Basil","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan, combine corn syrup, sugar and salt and bring mixture just to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly (to dissolve sugar).
