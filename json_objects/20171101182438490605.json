Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Garnet Monterey Pinot Noir. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444323,"title":"Garnet Monterey Pinot Noir","description":"This is a Pinot with power, but also with finesse. Aromas include ripe blackberries, cherry preserves, vanilla toffee and toasted French oak. You'll love the velvety richness of the attack.
