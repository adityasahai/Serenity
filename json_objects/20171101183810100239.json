White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 F. Heat an oven-proof skillet over medium heat, then add the olive oil and swirl around to coat the bottom of the pan. Fry the chicken till the skin is golden brown on both sides (not to cook the chicken, just to brown it). Remove the chicken from the pan, drain out the excess fat, add the wine and honey and swirl around to deglaze the pan. Arrange the chicken pieces in the pan, sprinkle with Red Robin Seasoning and pepper, then sprinkle with lots of lavender leaves and add the lemon slices on top.Set the pan in the oven and set a sheet of aluminum foil on top for 20 minutes.
