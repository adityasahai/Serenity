Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, toss olive oil, tequila, lime juice, shrimp, cilantro, salt and pepper together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour (you can leave it as long as overnight if you want to do this the day before!).When you’re ready to cook the shrimp, pull them out of the fridge. Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until it’s nice and hot. Pour shrimp and marinade into the pan and give it all a stir. Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently, until shrimp are nice and pink and have cooked through. (You could also skewer the shrimp and grill them if you’d like!)While the shrimp cook, toast your corn tortillas. I toast mine over an open oven burner flame for a few seconds on each side, but you could also toast them in a hot cast iron skillet or zap them in the microwave. Keep tortillas warm with a tea towel if your shrimp aren’t quite done.When shrimp have cooked, place 3 or 4 shrimp in the center of each corn tortilla and top with a few slices of avocado and some cilantro for garnish. Serve tacos with a lime wedge.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, toss olive oil, tequila, lime juice, shrimp, cilantro, salt and pepper together.
