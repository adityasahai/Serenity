Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.

Stir in 1 teaspoon sugar and let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, milk, the remaining sugar, butter, egg, egg yolk, and salt. Blend in 1½ cups flour. If using instant yeast, do not dissolve, but add here. Gradually add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.   On a lightly floured surface or in a mixer with a dough hook, knead the dough until smooth and springy, about 5 minutes. If using, knead in the currants. Place in an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a kitchen towel or loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours, or in the refrigerator overnight.Grease a 10-inch (12-cup) tube or Bundt pan or two 9-inch ring molds. (If the pan has a removable bottom, line the outside with foil to prevent the butter from dripping.) In place of a tube pan, place a custard cup or foil lined 1½-inch tube in the center of a round, deep baking pan or casserole.Punch down the dough, knead briefly, and shape into 1-inch balls. Combine the sugar, cinnamon, and, if using, nuts. Dip the balls into the melted butter, then roll in the sugar mixture to lightly coat. Arrange the balls in the prepared pan no more than halfway full. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap spritzed with cooking spray and let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F (350°F for a convection oven). Bake until golden brown or the center of the dough registers about 180°F on an instant-read thermometer, 40 to 50 minutes. Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then loosen the sides of the cake and invert onto a serving platter. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 2 days. Pull away pieces for your own barrel of fun.Variations:Blueberry Monkey Bread: Layer and scatter 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries with the dough pieces.Chocolate Monkey Bread: In the topping, substitute ¼ cup Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder for the cinnamon.Eggless Monkey Bread: Omit the eggs and increase the milk to 1 cup.Lemon Monkey Bread: In the topping, omit the cinnamon and mix the sugar with 4 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest and ¼ teaspoon ground mace.Poppy Seed Monkey Bread: In the topping, omit the cinnamon and mix the sugar with ¼ cup poppy seeds.Pumpkin Monkey Bread: Reduce the milk or sour cream to ½ cup, omit the egg yolk (use the whole egg), and add 1 cup (8.25 ounces/240 grams) unsweetened pure pack canned pumpkin. If desired, also add to the dough ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, and 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves.Spicier Monkey Bread: Add ½ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg with the cinnamon.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the dough: In a small bowl or measuring cup, dissolve the yeast (except instant yeast) in ¼ cup water.
