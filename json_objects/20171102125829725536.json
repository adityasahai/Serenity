Add the vanilla.In a separate bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour, sorghum flour, oats, potato starch, cocoa powder tapioca starch, espresso powder, ginger, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves. and salt.With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar mixture. Scrape down the bowl to make sure that the dough gets evenly mixed.Stir in the chocolate chips and crystallized ginger.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit for 30 minutes.

Line your baking sheets with parchment paper.Roll the dough into small balls, about 2 tablespoons per cookie, leaving 5-centimeters (2-inches) between cookies. Flatten the cookie dough with the palm of your hand, pressing it to about 1 centimeter (1/2-inch) thick.Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and place on wire cooling rack to cool.Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and cream cheese together.
