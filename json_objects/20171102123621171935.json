Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Dip the Oreo balls in the melted chocolate and set on parchment paper. Re-melt the chocolate as needed.Once the chocolate is set, drizzle with melted candy melts.
