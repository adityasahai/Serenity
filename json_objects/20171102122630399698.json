A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

(Seal it tight to prevent water from seeping into the pan. Newer springform pans do not need to be wrapped, but it is nice to do so as a precaution.)Boilenough water to add to the pan so that it will go halfway up the sides of the pan.While the water heats, add the cream cheese to your mixer and beat until creamy.Add 2 1/2 cups of sugar to the bowl and fluffy, scraping sides and bottom of bowl, as needed.Add the sour cream and beat until combined.Add the pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt and beat just until combined.Once the crust cools, pour the batter into the crust and transfer it to the roasting pan.Place the roasting pan on the center shelf of the oven. (If your rack does not slide easily in and out, leave rack pushed in.)Pour enough boilingwater in the roasting pan, without getting any on the batter, until it comes to about halfway up the sides of the springform pan.Bake for about 1 hour 45 minutes. Open the oven door, turn off the oven and shake the pan. The cheesecake should be set and the center should still giggle.
