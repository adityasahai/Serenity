A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a 15X11\" jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Grease the top with bakers  spray. Set aside. In a mixing bowl add the eggs and the sugar. Start on low speed and slowly increase to the highest speed and keep mixing for 3-4 minutes on high or until the eggs thicken and are pale in color. With a spatula fold in the flour, cocoa, baking powder and grated chocolate. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared baking pan and bake for 6-7 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the pan cool for 1 minute. In the meantime sprinkle powder sugar all over a clean tea towel. Invert cake onto the clean towel and gently remove the parchment paper. Roll up the cake with towel starting from the short side. Cool completely. When the cake is cold, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and continue whipping until firm peaks. Unroll the cake. Spread the cream evenly all over the cake. Sprinkle with the diced strawberries. Roll the cake again, this time without the towel. Chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. When ready to serve, sprinkle some powder sugar on top and cut in thin slices.
