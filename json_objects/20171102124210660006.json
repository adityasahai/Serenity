A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

They don't all need to be the same size, and in fact I encourage you to make them random. Cut more than 24 pieces if you like.Spray an 8-inch round or square baking pan with baking spray.Combine the coating ingredients in a small shallow bowl or plate and roll each piece of dough in the coating, then pile them into the prepared baking pan. You don't need to make an even layer, and you don't need them to go all the way to the edges of the pan - this is supposed to be a bumpy-lumpy interesting-looking bread.Cover the pan with plastic wrap or place it in a large plastic bag and tie the open end closed. Place the pan in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours.Remove the pan from the refrigerator and heat the oven to 325F.Remove the plastic and bake the bread until it is nicely browned and the internal temperature registers 190F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Let the bread cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool for another 20 minutes or so before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine all of the dough ingredients and knead by hand (mix first in a large bowl, then turn out to knead) or in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, until the dough is elastic.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour in a warm room.Divide the dough into at least 24 pieces.
