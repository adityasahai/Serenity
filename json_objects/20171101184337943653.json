Try pairing with Riesling, Sparkling Wine, and Zinfandel. In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
