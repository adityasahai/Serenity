Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Cook the noodles according to the package directions and immediately cool by running under cold water.In a large bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, peanut butter, vinegar, lime juice, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, hot chili paste, and hoisin sauce.Add the noodles and vegetables and mix everything together.Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the noodles according to the package directions and immediately cool by running under cold water.In a large bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, peanut butter, vinegar, lime juice, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, hot chili paste, and hoisin sauce.","ingredients":[{"id":16098,"name":"peanut butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg"},{"id":6175,"name":"hoisin sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the noodles and vegetables and mix everything together.Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve.","ingredients":[{"id":12023,"name":"sesame seeds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
