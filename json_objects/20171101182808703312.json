Heat mixture over medium, whisking constantly until mixture begins to bubble. After mixture starts to bubble, set timer for 1 minute and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, nutmeg, and butter; place over an ice bath to cool slightly (I only did this for about 5 minutes) before pouring into baked crust.
