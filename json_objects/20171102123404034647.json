Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts. Also wonderful on cold afternoons, served with biscotti to dip in \"\"Italian-style\"\". \"","price":"$19.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430626-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Johnson-Estate-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00D3GQSRW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare two baking sheets with a silpat or parchment paper.In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Stir to fully mix and set aside.Using a double boiler, a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan of boiling water OR the ‘melt’ function of a microwave, combine 1 ½ cups of the chocolate chips and the butter and place in the appropriate bowl for your melting method.  Heat until fully melted, stirring as needed, until smooth texture.In a medium mixing bowl combine the eggs and lightly beat with a whisk or mixer.  Add sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until fully combined.  Add melted chocolate mixture to butter-sugar-vanilla and stir to fully combine.Gradually stir in dry ingredients to fully combine and add the remaining 1/3 cup of chocolate chips, stirring to incorporate.Place tablespoon amounts of the cookie dough on the prepared baking dishes with 2 inch spacing in between them.  Bake for 10 minutes and check for doneness (the cookies will have some cracks in them, be glossy but not dry; do not overcook); if still too soft allow to bake a few more minutes.  Note:  I found different baking pan types make a difference of a few minutes in the baking duration.Allow cookies to cool about 5 minutes on the baking sheet, remove and place on cooling rack.  Gently place a candy Kiss in the center of each cookie, ensuring full contact of the bottom of the kiss and the top of the cookie; do not push the Kiss into the cookie.  The heat of the cookie will gently melt the bottom of the Kiss to the cookie and when fully cooled they will be adhered.Store any uneaten cookies in a sealed food storage container (refrigerated if over a few days).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
