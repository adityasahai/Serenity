Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too.

Also, discard any bits of pasta left in the skillet. Turn the heat to high, and when oil starts to shimmer, add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about four minutes. Add the celery, and cook, stirring often, until it lightens in color, about three minutes. Add the carrots and a pinch of salt and pepper, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook until the carrots are tender, about five minutes.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Add the diced jalapeño, toasted pasta, and three cups of the tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes. If pasta has absorbed all of the liquid, add a little more. The pasta will break apart into strands. Continue cooking until pasta is cooked, but still relatively firm, about three more minutes.
