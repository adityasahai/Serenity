When the oil is very hot add the garlic, it should sizzle. Allow it to cook, tossing occasionally until lightly golden brown. Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the vegetable stock, vinegar and sugar; set aside.Raise the heat to medium-high and add the ginger, cooking until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the Chinese broccoli, tossing to coat all the stalks with oil. Once the stalks begin to wilt slightly pour the stock mixture into the wok or skillet; cover with a tight fitting lid and lower the heat to medium.  Let the broccoli steam for 3 to 4 minutes, until stalks can be easily pierced with a paring knife.Remove the broccoli to a plate, leaving any liquid, garlic and ginger in the wok or skillet. Add the oyster sauce to the hot wok or skillet, allowing it to thicken slightly, about 1 minute. Strain the oyster sauce through a fine mesh sieve onto the plated broccoli. Cut the broccoli in half crosswise and serve hot.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In large wok or sloped sided skillet (large enough to hold all stalks in as close to a single layer as possible), heat canola oil over medium heat.
