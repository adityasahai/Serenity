Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.

Preheat oven to 375F. Spray both sides of the wonton wrapper with cooking spray and place snugly into muffin pan. Bake for 7-8 minutes until the edges are beginning to get golden brown and crisp. If you are having trouble getting the edges to brown, use tongs to remove the  wonton cups and place them directly on the oven rack to bake for 1-2 minutes. They should crisp up nicely.2. While the wonton skins are baking, in a large bowl, add the crab meat and mix gently with the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Delicately mix in the cream cheese, mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce. Taste and add additional salt or Worcestershire sauce if needed. 3. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling into each wonton cup. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 4 minutes (or you may serve as-is, just a little chilled). Garnish with green onion slivers or Mild Chili Threads.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375F.
