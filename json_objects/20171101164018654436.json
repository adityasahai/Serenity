White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

Prepare a grill for medium-high heat cooking. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, coriander, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Rub the mixture over the chicken. In another bowl, whisk together the jelly, vinegar, and rosemary.                          2. Brush the grill grate with oil. Grill the chicken halves, bone side down, for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook until there are dark grill marks on the skin, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken again and brush the skin with the jelly mixture. Continue cooking, brushing the skin every 10 minutes with the jelly mixture, reserving some for serving, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh but not touching the bone registers 165 degrees F, about 20 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the chicken into serving pieces and serve with the extra glaze on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a grill for medium-high heat cooking.
