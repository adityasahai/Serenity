White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Sprinkle the wings on both sides with the salt and pepper. Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and brown on all sides to crisp the skin. This will take 4-5 minutes.Pour in enough beer to cover the bottom of the skillet + about  inch (I used a very large skillet and only needed about half the bottle). Place the skillet in the oven and let the wings cook for about 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear and the internal temperature at the bone of the thickest part of the wings reads 165F on an instant read thermometer.Remove the skillet from the oven and remove the chicken from the skillet for a minute while you make the sauce.Over medium heat, pour a little more beer into the skillet, scraping and stirring the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. You can add just a little beer at a time -- you don't want your sauce to be watery but you don't want the bits on the bottom of the pan to burn. When the mixture is simmering, add the honey and sriracha and stir. Add more beer if your sauce is too thick. Add more sriracha to your taste.Put the chicken pieces back in the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. You may need to spoon the sauce over the wings.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oil in a medium to large cast iron skillet.
