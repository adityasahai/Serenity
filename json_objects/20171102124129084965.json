paired with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.
