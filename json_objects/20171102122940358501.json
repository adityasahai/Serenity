really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Season chicken with paprika, salt and pepper.
