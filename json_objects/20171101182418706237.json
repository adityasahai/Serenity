Chowder can benefit from a crisp white to cut through the rich, creamy broth - or you can go big or go home with a rich, buttery chardonnay. One wine you could try is CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

Drain. Mash half of the potatoes and set aside.                            Fry the bacon until very crisp. Crumple the bacon and set aside.                            Fry the onion inn the bacon grease until translucent and soft.                            Dump the cooked onions into a large stockpot. Add the flour and heat until the mixture is bubbly and the flour is well dissolved. Add the milk and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. You need to watch your pot pretty carefully while bringing to a boil and heating. The bottom tends to easily scorch. Once boiling add the salt, pepper, bacon, corn and all the potatoes. (If desired reserve some of the bacon for the garnish.)                            Heat soup until hot.
