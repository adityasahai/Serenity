A light and crisp sparkling rosé complements fluffy angel food cake - even more so if you're serving it with strawberries. Of course a sweet sparkling white wine will work too. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Then sift them both together again with the salt.Using the whisk attachment on a stand mixer, beat the eggs and cream of tartar together on medium speed until foamy. Increase the speed to medium-high and add the vanilla and lemon juice and almond extract if desired. Gradually add in granulated sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, meaning that when a beater is lifted from the mixture, the peak stands straight up without curling over.Sift 1/4 cup of the flour mixture over the whipped egg whites and gently fold in. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time.Pour the mixture into an angel food cake pan, and gently tap the pan on the counter several times to release any large air bubbles.Bake the cake on the lowest rack of the oven at 350 degrees for approximately 40 to 45 minutes. Immediately turn the cake over to cool after removing it from the oven and cool thoroughly before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the over to 350 degrees.Sift the flour and confectioners' sugar before measuring.
