A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Grease and flour two nine inch round pans. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the eggs, milk, butter and vanilla, mix for 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in the hot coffee last. Batter will be thin. Pour evenly into the prepared pans. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake is done through. Cool in the pans on a cooling rack, then turn cakes out of pan. Frost with Malted Chocolate Buttercream. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and vanilla on medium speed until creamy. In a large bowl, sift together the malt powder, cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter and mix at low speed until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Once all of the dry ingredients have been incorporated, add in 2 tablespoons of cream. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the buttercream for about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. If you want your frosting a little thinner, gradually add in more cream, 1 teaspoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350.
