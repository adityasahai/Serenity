works really well with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":454206,"title":"Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir","description":"The 2014 Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir is a blend of fruit from the John Sebastiano, Clos Pepe, Cargasacchi, and Lindley Vineyards. The actual blend is 64% John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir, 22% Clos Pepe, 9% Lindley, and 6% Cargasacchi. Clonally, this wine is a blend of 8 different clones which also provides for a wide range of flavors within one wine. The 2014 Pinot Noir Sta. Rita Hills should be a classic expression of the region, showing lots of spice, red fruit and dried soils aromas and flavors. Balanced, polished and elegant with plenty of fruit, it should certainly be an outstanding wine, and at the price, is an excellent value in Pinot Noir.","price":"$32.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/454206-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/siduri-sta-rita-hills-pinot-noir-2014/168102"}]},"instructions":"Cut all ingredients to desired size and combined in a medium bowl.Stir well and salt to desired level.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut all ingredients to desired size and combined in a medium bowl.Stir well and salt to desired level.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]}]}]}]}
