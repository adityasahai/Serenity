Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large skillet coated with olive oil, sauté the mushrooms over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and become golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove to a plate.Remove sausage from the casings and sauté ( in the same skillet) over medium heat, stirring and crumbling as you cook, until the sausage is cooked through. Remove to a plate.If you use pork sausage, you may want to discard some of the excess fat from the skillet at this point.  I use a leaner turkey sausage and keep the little bit of fat that remains.  Add the milk and cornstarch/water mixture.  Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 minute or until the cornstarch is incorporated and the mixture has thickened slightly.  Stir in the salt and pepper and 1/2 cup of the cheese, stirring until just melted, and remove from the heat.In the same skillet or the pot in which you cooked the pasta, combine the cheese sauce with the sausage, mushrooms, greens, and pasta.  Transfer the mixture to a lightly-greased, 2-quart baking dish.  Top with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the mixture is hot throughout and the cheese is melted.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large skillet coated with olive oil, sauté the mushrooms over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and become golden brown, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove to a plate.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove sausage from the casings and sauté ( in the same skillet) over medium heat, stirring and crumbling as you cook, until the sausage is cooked through.","ingredients":[{"id":1017063,"name":"sausage","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-pork-sausage.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove to a plate.If you use pork sausage, you may want to discard some of the excess fat from the skillet at this point.
