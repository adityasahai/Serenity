Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":454206,"title":"Siduri Sta.

Clonally, this wine is a blend of 8 different clones which also provides for a wide range of flavors within one wine. The 2014 Pinot Noir Sta. Rita Hills should be a classic expression of the region, showing lots of spice, red fruit and dried soils aromas and flavors.
