Add the potatoes. Cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes.Place the potatoes in a bowl, add butter and milk. Beat until combined. Reserve about 1/2 cup of potato (this is to make ghosts). Add brown food coloring until it is the color you desire. Note: You want the potatoes thick, not runny. You can also add salt and pepper too.Place the potatoes on a plate to make a long mound to resemble a grave. Take once slice of raw potato and with a red food coloring pen, write Rip on the sliced potato. Stick the sliced potato at the end of the mound to look like a grave.Take the reserved potatoes and place in a baggie. Pipe half the mixture onto a plate or parchment paper, to resemble a ghost. I shaped it up to look like a ghost. Add 2 peppercorns for the eyes and 1 peppercorn for the mouth. Do the same with remaining potatoes.This dish will get cold while making. I reheated it in the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes to warm up for serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring 4 cups of water to a boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the potatoes.
