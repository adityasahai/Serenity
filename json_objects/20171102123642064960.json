Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Mix the dry ingredients (almond flour through nutmeg) in a medium bowl and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the rest of the ingredients.Add the dry mix to the wet mix and stir, just until combined. It will be like batter at this point. Chill in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes or until it's firm like regular cookie dough.Form the dough into twenty-eight 1½\" balls and place on a cookie sheet (I put mine on a Silpat) about 1½\" apart. There's no need to flatten them.Bake for 14 minutes. They'll crackle a little (that's good!) and still be soft. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 350°F (176°C).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the dry ingredients (almond flour through nutmeg) in a medium bowl and set aside.
