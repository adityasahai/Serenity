Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel.

Refrigerate until ready to serve.                          Combine the turkey, the remaining garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl.
