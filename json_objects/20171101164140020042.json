Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon.

I do that by adding the eggs to cold water, heating them over medium heat and gradually increasing it to high heat. Once boiling, I boil the eggs for 2 minutes, then I remove them from the heat, cover the pot and let it sit for 10 minutes. I then run the eggs under cold water for a few minutes and let them soak in the cold water until ready to peel.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add bacon. I think bacon is best when cooked over medium-low heat, as it crisps up evenly. Cook the bacon until all the fat is rendered and then turn off the heat. Place the bacon on a paper towel to slightly drain and cool. Gently pour the bacon fat into a bowl or cup. To assemble the salads, pile your spinach on a plate and cover with the sliced hard boiled eggs, avocado and gorgonzola. Crumble on two slices of bacon and season with a bit of pepper if you'd like. I find that this salad doesn't need a lot of salt since the components are so salty.hot bacon dressingAdd the bacon grease, , minced garlic, vinegar, sugar and mustard to a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the dressing slightly emulsifies. Season with the salt and pepper. Before serving, add in the crumbled bacon. You can keep this over low heat while stirring occasionally until ready to serve. I suggest reheating it in a saucepan like so. This is the combo I've come to love over the years, but you can experiment with different vinegars, more bacon fat and other spices too!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"I like to begin by boiling the eggs so they are finished by the time the dressing is ready.
