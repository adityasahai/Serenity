Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 42 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage. Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose. The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.","price":"$41.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438237-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gary-farrell-russian-river-pinot-noir-2007/102829"}]},"instructions":"Chop tomatoes and transfer them to a large bowl.Finely chop seeded bell pepper and jalapeños.

You won't notice the peels and the color is prettier with the peel on. Transfer peaches to your bowl.Add Chopped cilantro, 2 Tbsp lime juice, 1/2 bunch chopped cilantro, 2 Tbsp lime juice, 1½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Add more salt and pepper to taste if desired.
