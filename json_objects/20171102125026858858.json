Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431299,"title":"Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Luminous pear and apple notes animated with aromas of lime and lemon.","price":"$12.75","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431299-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2016-Proverb-Pinot-Grigio-750mL/dp/B074G3D221"}]},"instructions":"Special equipment: 25 metal or wooden skewers              If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before skewering food.
