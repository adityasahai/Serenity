Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook noodles according to package directions, or until al dente. Set aside. If the noodles are done before the rest of your components are ready, toss them with a little oil while you drain them so they don't stick together while they sit to the side.Whisk together all sauce ingredients, set aside.Prepping your tofu by slicing and draining it on some paper towels. Dab the tofu to remove excess water.Cook the tofu - Heat oil in a large skillet. Get your pan screaming hot and add the tofu. Leave it for 30 seconds or a minute, then toss it around, stir frying for a few more minutes until it is nice and golden. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside.Cook the eggplant and mushrooms - Using the same pan as the tofu (wipe out any burnt parts), add some more oil, heat the pan up again and add in the mushrooms and eggplant.  Add just a little splash of the sauce (you'll add the rest at the end). Stir fry until browned and until the mushrooms are soft. The time will vary depending on the heat of your stove, I cooked mine for a total of about 8-10 minutes.Turn the heat to low and add noodles to the pan and drizzle in more of the sauce. You might not use all of it (and it's on the sweet side), so start with about half, adding more later as you taste. Add the tofu back into the pan, a few handfuls of greens, the scallions and toss everything together. Taste and add more of the sauce, or salt/pepper if you wish.Remove from heat and serve, finishing with a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook noodles according to package directions, or until al dente.
