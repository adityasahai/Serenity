Add finely diced yellow onion and saute until soft and golden (5 min). Add pressed garlic cloves and saute another 1-2 min, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Whisk in 2 Tbsp flour and cook another 1 min until flour is golden. Add 1 cups milk and 1 cups chicken broth. Whisk mixture until smooth and bring to a simmer. Stir in  Tbsp sea salt and  tsp pepper (or season to taste). Remove from heat.Drain potatoes and arrange half of them in the bottom of your casserole dish (it doesn't matter how the first layer is arranged, just separate the potato slices as you put them in).
