Add the cubed cold butter and mix until crumbly.                          Chill until ready to use. Store leftover topping in the freezer.                          For the crisp filling: Peel the apples and pears, then dice into large pieces and put in a bowl. Toss in the orange and lemon zest and juice, granulated sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon and ginger. Add the cranberry sauce and toss until thoroughly combined                          For the toffee pecans: Combine the pecans, granulated sugar, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until caramelized and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread on a half-sheet pan and leave until cooled.                          For the cinnamon creme anglaise: Heat the cream, milk, granulated sugar, ground cinnamon and cinnamon sticks in a saucepan until it boils. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to steep for about 20 minutes. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.                          Reheat the cream mixture. Whisk together the egg yolks. Then slowly whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolks by the ladleful. Return the mixture to the pot and heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes.                          Strain the mixture and divide among six 2- to 4-ounce small ramekins.                          To assemble the crisp: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.                          Grease six 6-ounce brulee dishes with butter. Spoon the crisp filling into the dishes and divide the crisp topping evenly to top them. Bake until the tops are golden and the edges are bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the depth of the dishes.                          Let cool until just warm, 20 to 30 minutes. Top with the toffee pecans and serve with the cinnamon creme anglaise.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: Six 2- to 4-ounce ramekins Six 6-ounce brulee dishes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404781,"name":"ramekin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ramekin.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"For the crisp topping: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, granulated and brown sugars, oats, pecans and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":12142,"name":"pecans","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":8120,"name":"oats","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the cubed cold butter and mix until crumbly.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Chill until ready to use.
