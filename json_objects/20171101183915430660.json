Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples. An excellent balance gives this wine strength and structure. It is dry and smooth on the palate with a pleasant, mineral aftertaste.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436696-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/luna-nuda-pinot-grigio-2013/134978"}]},"instructions":"Prepare the broiler by turning it on the low setting.Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Use a pastry brush to lightly coat each fillet with olive oil, using 1 tablespoon of oil total.  Place the fillets skin side down on the baking sheet, and season each piece of salmon with salt & pepper.  Set aside.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan, over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook, without obtaining any color, for 5 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and season with salt & pepper.  Cook until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the edamame and cook for another couple minutes.  In the last minute of cooking, stir in the cilantro.  Taste, and season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.Once you start cooking the onions, put the salmon in the oven and broil for 6-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.  (The fillet in the photos was on the thick side and cooked for about 9 minutes).  Remove the fish from the oven.  Slide a spatula between the skin and flesh of the fish (this should be very easy, and the skin will stay stuck to the foil), and transfer the fish to a plate.Top with warm tomato & edamame salad, and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the broiler by turning it on the low setting.Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.
