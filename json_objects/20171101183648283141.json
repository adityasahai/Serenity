Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"In a medium saucepan, combine all sauce ingredients and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.In a large bowl using a fork, combine all of the meatball ingredients. Gently mix with your fork so as not to smash the ingredients together. Too much working of the mixture can cause your meatballs to turn out tough.Once everything is mixed, use your hands to be sure everything is combined well. Work with hands for no longer than one minute. Just long enough for everything to come together.Use a cookie scoop to create meatballs. I dont roll mine, just place them straight from the cookie scoop into the pan. You can roll them in your palms first, but again, only for a moment, dont overwork the meat!Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in large saute pan or skillet. Brown meatballs on both sides, creating a nice crust. Remove meatballs and drain fat. Dont scrape out any bits of meat from the pan!Deglaze the pan with 2 tablespoons of wine. Return meatballs to the pan, pour marinara over the meatballs and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for a minimum of 30 minutes. You can simmer the meatballs for up to 2 hours if you like, but you may need to add a little water throughout the process to keep the marinara from thickening too much.Serve over cooked spaghetti noodles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan, combine all sauce ingredients and mix well.
