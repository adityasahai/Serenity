Heat the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until you see bubbles forming on top.2. Meanwhile, melt the butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour over the top, stirring constantly until a thick paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. (In classic French cuisine, a mixture of flour and fat such as this is known as a roux. In reality, this mixture is known to behave differently in every kitchen, so don’t be alarmed if it becomes quite thick.)3. Slowly add the warm milk to the flour and butter paste in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Continue cooking, whisking almost constantly until the mixture thickens considerably, about 5 minutes. It should be thick but still spreadable and perhaps even pourable. Add the cheese, whisking constantly until it has melted. Season with the cayenne or hot sauce and salt and pepper to taste. If you want to be fussy about it, you can strain the sauce through a sieve to remove any lumps before serving. The sauce will thicken upon cooling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until you see bubbles forming on top.2.
