Add the confectioners sugar and beat just until the sugar is combined. Set aside. Tip: Use a stand mixer; a hand mixer is not likely to have enough power for the heavy texture of the candy.In a medium-size heavy-bottomed pan, combine sugar, corn syrup, and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals.Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 260 degrees F, a hard ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup.When the syrup has reached 260 degrees, pour the warmed honey into the syrup, stir carefully but quickly to combine, and continue cooking, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 290 degrees, a soft crack stage. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches 280 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 290 degrees. In addition, remove the pan from the heat just before the syrup reaches 290 degrees to prevent it from going over 290 degrees.Meanwhile, after you have added the honey, and as the temperature of the syrup reaches about 270 degrees F, continue beating the egg whites on medium high speed until stiff peaks form. Stop the mixer, remove the whisk attachment and attach the paddle.When the sugar mixture reaches 290 degrees F, remove the pan from the heat. Immediately start pouring the hot sugar mixture, in a thin steady stream, into the beaten egg whites, while beating with the electric mixer at medium speed. This will cause the egg whites to double in volume. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it.Slowly add the vanilla. Increase the speed to high and beat until the nougat cools a bit and becomes thick and shiny, about 5 minutes. Stop beating and remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a heavy wooden spoon, quickly stir in the chopped almonds and pistachios and optional cherry halves; the mixture will be very thick and may be difficult to stir.Immediately pour the nougat into the prepared pan, smooth the top and press down to pack the nougat down into the pan as firmly and evenly as possible. Tip: Spread a thin coating of vegetable shortening on a heavy wooden spoon to help with the stickiness and removing the nougat from the bowl, or grease your hands with a little vegetable shortening, the nougat should be cool enough at this point to use your hands.Cover the top of the nougat with another sheet of rice paper or wafer paper, pieced together without overlapping if necessary to cover the entire top, smooth and lightly press the paper over the nougat.Let the nougat sit until cool and thoroughly set, 6 to 8 hours or overnight.When the nougat is firm, remove from the pan by grabbing the edge of the parchment paper and lifting out of the pan, peel away the parchment paper and discard, but do not remove the rice paper or wafer paper.Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the nougat into 2-inch by 1-inch rectangles; cut the nougat lengthwise into 2-inch strips, and then cut each strip into 1 inch pieces. Tip: The nougat will cut easier if the knife is hot. Run the knife under hot water, then wipe dry before each cut.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the honey in a bowl, and set the bowl in a larger pan of simmering water to create a bain marie water bath to warm the honey.In a large bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form.","ingredients":[{"id":1124,"name":"egg whites","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404699,"name":"double boiler","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/double-boiler.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the confectioners sugar and beat just until the sugar is combined.
