oven to 350 F. Line an 8x8\" square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a slight overhang for easier removal.In a large heat-safe bowl, heat chocolate and coconut oil on high power in microwave in 30 second increments until melted, stirring in between.Whisk in coconut sugar until smooth then beat in vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Whisk in baking powder, cocoa powder and slowly fold in flour until just combined.Spread half of the batter into the prepared pan and set aside other half. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the date caramel sauce: Place dates, coconut oil and water in a small pot over medium heat and bring to the boil. Simmer for a few minutes until dates are soft while stirring and mashing down with a fork. Remove from heat and use a hand blender to blend until smooth (alternatively place in a blender to blend). Add cinnamon and enough milk to blend until the consistency of caramel sauce.After 15 minutes, remove brownies from oven and lightly spread 1/3-1/2 cup caramel sauce (reserving some for topping) then sprinkle in 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Top with remaining brownie batter, smoothing top with offset spatula. Evenly sprinkle with chocolate chips and remaining pecansReturn to oven and bake for 25 to 28 minutes, or until center has just set and no longer jiggly. Remove from oven and allow brownies to cool completely before cutting. You can refrigerate or freeze the pan to cool faster.Cut into equal squares with a very sharp knife. Drizzle with reserved caramel sauce, if desired.Brownies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 F.
