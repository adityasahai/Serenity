Then cut each slice into quarters and set aside.  Put the eggs in a medium size bowl.  Add the buttermilk (or milk).  Whisk the eggs and buttermilk together and set aside.Put the corn flakes in a medium size bowl.  Keep the corn flakes whole.  Set aside.  Dip a piece of the bread in the egg mixture.  Don’t soak the bread; just a quick dip to get the entire piece wet with the egg mixture.  Then, put the bread into the corn flakes and give the bread a bit of a push or smash into the corn flakes to get them to stick to the bread.  Do this on both sides of the bread.For the remaining pieces of bread, repeat the process of dipping into the egg mixture, and corn flakes.  Add the butter to a pan and heat on medium heat.  When the butter is melted, add the pieces of French toast to the pan.  Make sure not to crowd the pieces in the pan.  Watch them closely and turn down the heat just a touch if they’re browning too fast.  The idea is to let them cook slowly and turn to a golden color so that the egg mixture around the bread gets fully cooked.Using tongs, gently turn over the French toast to cook each of the sides.  Continue turning the pieces so each side is a golden color.  Some of the corn flakes may get a little darker golden which is fine too.  It may take about 6 minutes until all sides get cooked and are a golden color.  After they are done, put them on a plate so that you can add the glaze.For the Glaze:  In a small bowl, add the powdered sugar, buttermilk (or milk), and orange flavoring.  Whisk all of the ingredients together.  If the glaze is a bit too thick, just add a touch more buttermilk.  If it’s too then, then add a bit more powdered sugar.  Then, using a spoon, drizzle the glaze over the pieces of French toast.Zest an orange or a tangelo.  Garnish the French toast with the zest.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the Bread","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut 3 pieces of bread into thick slices (1 ½ inches thick).
