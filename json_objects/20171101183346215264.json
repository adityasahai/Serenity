Try pairing with Lambrusco Dolce, Late Harvest Riesling, and Vin Santo. These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it.

In a smaller bowl whisk together the flour, lemon zest, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, kosher salt, and all spice. Pour the dry mix over the apples and toss to coat. Fold in the raspberries.Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust.Make the oatmeal cookie crumble by mixing together the oats, brown sugar, Organic Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour, cinnamon, and kosher salt. Use a box grater to add the butter to the bowl and mix it in with your fingers until coarse crumbles are formed. Sprinkle the crumbles over the top of the pie. This makes a lot so I will kind of gently press the oatmeal cookie crumbles down a little before adding the rest. It forms a crust that is unbelievable.Bake for 45- 50 minutes, until the raspberry apple filling is bubbly and the crumble topping is golden.Let the pie cool before slicing (or just skip the slices and eat it with a fork. No judgement here).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375F and lower the oven rack just below the center position.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place/press your pie crust into the pie plate and refrigerate until you are ready to fill it.","ingredients":[{"id":18334,"name":"pie crust","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pie-crust.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the apples in a large bowl and toss with the lemon juice.
