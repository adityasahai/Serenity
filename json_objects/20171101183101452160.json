Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent. A sweet entry leads to a rounded, lush, moderately full-bodied palate with a lengthy, flavorful finish.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428475-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/NV-Solera-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00HSME8OW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Add the almond butter, baking soda, and brown sugar. Mix everything together very well. Depending how thick and/or cold your almond butter is, you'll have to use some arm muscles. Fold in the chocolate chips until combined.Scoop the dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons each, onto prepared baking sheet. Bake two batches - 6 cookies on each baking sheet each. Gently press down on the dough mounds with the back of a spoon, as pictured above. If you find the cookie dough balls are oily-looking from your almond butter, blot each with a paper towel.Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked, but that's ok. For crispy cookies, bake for up to 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.Cookies stay fresh stored covered at room temperature for up to 7 days. Cookies freeze well, up to 3 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.In a medium bowl, beat the egg.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the almond butter, baking soda, and brown sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":12195,"name":"almond butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almond-butter.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix everything together very well.
