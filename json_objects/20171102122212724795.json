Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Albarino, and Moscato d'Asti. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.

Add sugar, eggs, melted butter, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon; beat until mixture is smooth. Add 2 cups flour; stir until well mixed. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.Turn dough onto a lightly floured pastry mat or pastry board; knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time if dough is too sticky.Place dough in a well greased bowl; turn dough over once to grease the top. Cover bowl with a small kitchen towel and let dough rise is a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.Prepare one large baking pan with sides; lightly grease the pan with shortening.Punch dough down then turn onto a lightly floured pastry mat or pastry board; knead dough briefly, 4 to 5 times. Roll the dough into a large rectangle about 30 inches by 15 inches.In a small bowl, stir together melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecans. Sprinkle evenly over rolled out dough to within  inch of the edges.Roll-up dough jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Shape into a ring; pinch the ends to fasten together.Cover and let ring rise is a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Bake: Bake ring 60 minutes, or until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. Remove rolls from oven. Place pan on a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Tip: During baking, if crust is getting too brown, loosely place a piece of foil over the top to prevent the crust from over-browning. Tip: Use an instant read thermometer to test your bread for doneness. The temperature should be between 200 and 210 degrees.In a small bowl, combine confectioners sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla, bourbon, and enough milk to make a good spreading consistency. Spread icing onto still warm rolls, or pipe icing stripes with a pastry bag and decorating tip.While icing is still soft, sprinkle alternating colors of purple, green, and yellow with the sanding sugars.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water, warm milk and yeast; stir and let sit until yeast is dissolved, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add sugar, eggs, melted butter, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon; beat until mixture is smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 cups flour; stir until well mixed.
