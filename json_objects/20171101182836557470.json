Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil. Gently wipe the Portobello mushroom caps with a damp papertowel and then place, gill side up, on the baking sheet. Brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slide into the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Flip the mushrooms and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes until softened and browned. Remove from the oven and flip gill side up again. Sprinkle with about half of the Romano cheese. Set aside.Now, it’s time to cook the eggs. I am going to leave that up to you – but I highly recommend a runny yolk via poaching, over-easy cooking or frying.Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the Canadian bacon and cook until golden, flipping once – about 1 minute.To serve, place two Portobello mushroom caps onto each of four plates. Top each with a slice of Canadian bacon, an egg (prepared, of course – see above) and a sprinkle of Romano cheese. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
