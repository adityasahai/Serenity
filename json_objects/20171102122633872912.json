and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"Add oil to a small saute pan over medium heat. When hot, add jalapenos and saute until caramelized. Add garlic, and before it begins to brown, deglaze with white wine. Next add mustard and apricot preserves and bring to a simmer. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool while you complete the other steps.  Preheat oven to 400.  Place parchment paper on planks, add salmon, lightly salt and pepper, place a rosemary sprig on each fillet, and liberally apply cooled apricot mixture. Place cedar planks on gas burners. When planks begin to smoke, place onto a sheet pan (to catch drippings) and into the preheated oven. Cook salmon until medium-rare to medium (or to your preference) - mine took about 10 minutes, but this will depend on the thickness of your salmon, size of fillets, and desired doneness. Remove from oven and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes until serving. Garnish with lemon zest and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add oil to a small saute pan over medium heat.
