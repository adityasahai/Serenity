A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.Lay out the thawed puff pastry sheet on a floured surface, and gently use a rolling pin to even out the creases and roll it out until it forms about an 11 x 18-inch rectangle. Transfer the puff pastry to the prepared baking sheet. Use a knife to score a very thin border around the outside of puff pastry. Then use a fork to poke lots ofholes into middle of pastry, to minimize inflation.Use a pastry brush to brush the whisked egg whites all over the top of the puff pastry. Then transfer it to the oven and bake according to package directions until it is turns golden, about 10-12 minutes, keeping an eye on it while baking to be sure that it doesn't puff up. (If it does, just pull it out of the oven and use a spatula to pat it back down until it's flat, repeating if needed.) Remove and let cool for 5 minutes.While the puff pastry is baking, prepare your cream cheese spread, reserving part of it (as directed below) to make a glaze.Once the puff pastry is ready, spread the cream cheese spread evenly on top of the pastry. Then sprinkle the fresh blueberries, blueberry almonds, and toasted coconut evenly on top of the cream cheese. Drizzle the glaze evenly on top.Slice and serve immediately.To Make The Cream Cheese Spread/Glaze:Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl or measuring cup until smooth. Taste, and add extra honey if needed to sweeten.Transfer 1/4 of the cream cheese spread mixture to a separate bowl, and whiskin a teaspoon at a time of milk until the mixture reaches more of a glaze-like consistency. (If it accidentally gets too thin, you can add in a few spoonfuls of powdered sugar to thicken.) This will be your glaze for the final step of the recipe.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To Make The Blueberry Almond Tart:Preheat oven to 400F.
