A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Sonoma Portworks DECO port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428769,"title":"NV Sonoma Portworks DECO port","description":"A unique California after-dinner wine, DECO is an exceptional blend of hand-selected California ports gently kissed with essences of natural dark chocolate.
