Stir over medium-high heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture boils and thickens, about 7 minutes. Whisk yolks and cornstarch in medium bowl. Gradually drizzle in half of hot berry mixture, whisking constantly, until yolks are warm to the touch; return to saucepan and whisk into remaining berry mixture. Stir over medium-high heat until mixture begins to boil and thickens, about 3 minutes. Whisk in butter and zest, stirring until butter is melted and smooth. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl. Cover tightly and chill overnight.The next day, prepare the crust. Lightly butter a 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Combine flour, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until almonds are finely ground. Add butter; and pulse a few times or until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk egg yolk and almond extract together in a small bowl; add to flour mixture and pulse until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball, then press onto bottom and up sides of prepared tart pan. Pierce crust all over with fork; freeze 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line crust with a sheet lightly-buttered foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until crust is set, about 12 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights. Bake for another 16 to 18 minutes or until crust is lightly golden. Place on a baking rack and cool completely.When crust is cooled, fill with chilled filling mixture. Arrange remaining 4 cups of blueberries on top. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup sliced almonds around edges. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or up to 1 day before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare filling, combine 1 1/2 lbs (4 cups) blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan, crushing berries with the back of a spoon or a potato masher.
