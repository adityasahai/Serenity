Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441154,"title":"King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris","description":"Light straw with emerald green hue. Aromas of green apple, citrus, honeysuckle, white peach, apricot and floral notes. Flavors of pear, melon, lemon and lime, wet stone, kiwi and honey.

Using a food processor, pulse the salmon in batches. You may want to partially freeze it for about 15 minutes, for better results. The fish should not be mushy and pureed, rather have a coarse texture, and be flaky. I pulsed my fish for about 3 pulses only.Using a nonstick skillet, heat 1 Tablespoon of butter and cook the onion until tender and lightly golden. Cool slightly. Wipe out the skillet and set aside.Add all the ingredients except the oil and the additional 1½ cups panko breadcrumbs to the salmon. Gently toss together.Using an ice cream scoop (or your hands, of course), portion out the salmon.Dredge the salmon cakes in the breadcrumbs, shaping into 2-3 inch circles.Heat about 2 tablespoons oil in a nonstick skillet to medium-high heat and cook the salmon for about 3 minutes per side, just until golden brown. The fish cooks very quickly, so don't overcook it by using low heat or covering the skillet, etc. It will be dry, if you're not careful.Take off the heat and drain on a paper towel. Wipe out the skillet and repeat with the rest of the salmon cakes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the salmon into 2-3 inch chunks.
