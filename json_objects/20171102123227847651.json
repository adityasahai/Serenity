Stir in milk, olive oil and salt, then add 2 cups of the flour and set the stand mixer with whisk attachment and blend mixture on low until well combined. Switch to the hook attachment and add in 2 cups flour, knead mixture until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding in additional flour (up to 1/2 cup) as needed to make a soft, smooth dough (it should pull away from the sides of the bowl). Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel and place in a warm place to double in size, about 1 1/2 hours.Punch dough down and divide into 4 or 5 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball on a lightly floured work surface, while tucking edges under several times (I first would flatten slightly, then roll a piece as if rolling up cinnamon rolls, then tuck edges under to make a smooth ball, this just helps it hold it's structure). Transfer rolls to a Silpat lined baking sheet, cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap (or dust tops of rolls lightly with flour then cover with ungreased plastic wrap), let rest 40 - 45 minutes until nearly doubled. Preheat oven to 425 degrees during the last 10 minutes of rising. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg white and water until foamy and gently brush egg wash over tops of rolls. Bake in preheated oven 19 - 24 minutes until hollow, laying foil over rolls near end as needed to prevent excessive browning. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. Cut top centers from rolls and store in an airtight container.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, whisk together 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast has dissolved, allow to rest 5 - 10 minutes.
