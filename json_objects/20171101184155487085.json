Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Add olive oil and butter to a large skillet over medium heat.Add sausage and mushrooms and cook until sausage has just begun to turn brown, about 3-5 minutes.Stir in tomatoes, chicken stock and heavy cream.Add pasta and stir to make sure well-combined.
