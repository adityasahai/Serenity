Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics. The artful combination of these three regions delivers baked apple, pear and lemon cream flavors, accented by an elegant finish of sweet vanilla.","price":"$26.65","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428231-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Pines-Sonoma-Monterey-Chardonnay/dp/B01A8WOKCS"}]},"instructions":"Prepare the dressing by mixing all ingredients until well-blended.   Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.Preheat a small skillet over medium heat.  Slice the sausage links into 1/4-inch coins and place into the skillet.  Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side until it is lightly browned.  Flip each piece and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the second side is lightly browned.  Remove from heat and set aside.While the chicken sausage cooks, combine the salad greens, bell pepper, feta cheese and the pear.  Divide the mixture among two large salad plates.   Divide the chicken sausage pieces among the two salads and as desired,  drizzle the vinaigrette over the salads.Serve while the chicken sausage is slightly warm.Cassie's Notes:Use any salad dressing you prefer; the curry powder is surprisingly sweet when paired with the apple cider vinegar and pairs perfectly with the sausage, feta and pears.  Al Fresco All Natural chicken sausage is widely available but if you can't find it, just substitute your favorite chicken, pork or vegetarian sausage.The bell peppers didn't take away from the salad but didn't really add anything either.  Make this salad even simpler by omitting them.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the dressing by mixing all ingredients until well-blended.
