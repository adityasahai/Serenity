Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Slice the tomatoes in 1/4 inch slices and salt heavily. This is so that excess water comes out of the tomatoes and keeps the tart from getting soggy. Leave the salted tomatoes aside for ten minutes. After ten minutes, use a paper towel to wipe off extra salt and moisture from the tomatoes. Arrange the puff pasty in a pie or regular baking dish. Make sure to add a little bit of butter into the tray before putting the pastry in to prevent it from sticking. Spread the Dijon evenly over the pastry. Add 1 teaspoon of thyme then arrange the tomatoes on top of the Dijon and thyme. Add the other teaspoon of thyme over the tomatoes.Drizzle the balsamic vinegar on top. Garnish wish a few sprigs of thyme. Bake for 45 minutes or until the pastry is a deep caramel color. You want to take it out just before the edges begin to char, and not sooner. More tomato recipes On Food Republic:Tomates Farcies RecipeBasic Tomato SauceHeirloom Tomato Chutney Recipe","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
