Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431299,"title":"Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Luminous pear and apple notes animated with aromas of lime and lemon.","price":"$12.75","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431299-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2016-Proverb-Pinot-Grigio-750mL/dp/B074G3D221"}]},"instructions":"Prepare the linguine according to package directions, drain and set aside.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic and cook until it begins to turn brown.Add the wine and bring to a simmer.Add the shrimp, salt, and pepper, and stir until heated through.Right before removing from heat, stir in the tomatoes.Add the shrimp-tomato mixture and baby arugula to the pot with the cooked, drained linguine, and toss gently.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the linguine according to package directions, drain and set aside.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic and cook until it begins to turn brown.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":10720420,"name":"linguine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the wine and bring to a simmer.","ingredients":[{"id":14084,"name":"wine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the shrimp, salt, and pepper, and stir until heated through.Right before removing from heat, stir in the tomatoes.","ingredients":[{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the shrimp-tomato mixture and baby arugula to the pot with the cooked, drained linguine, and toss gently.","ingredients":[{"id":11959,"name":"baby arugula","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"},{"id":10720420,"name":"linguine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]}]}]}]}
