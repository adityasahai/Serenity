Slowly add the dry mixture to the sugar mixture, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. If your dough is too dry, add a teaspoon or two of milk or cream until it is easier to handle. Add the food coloring, mixing until no swirls of color are left. Note: to attain the perfect “blue box” color, I’ve found that 3 parts blue, 1 part green, and a dot of yellow coloring make a perfect faux-Tiffany hue.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Using an ice cream scoop or large spoon, wrap spoonfuls of dough around the filling of your choice, making sure that it is completely contained by dough. Form into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Place dough balls one inch apart on the baking sheet and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies have a dull finish on top. If you’re not sure about doneness, lift one cookie up; the bottom should be lightly golden, not brown. Remove cookies from the oven and cool completely before frosting.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Prepare the icing. Mix the confectioners’ sugar with just enough cream so that the icing is thick but still easily stirred.
