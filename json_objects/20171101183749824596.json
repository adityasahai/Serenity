Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Stone Ground Grits:Bring water, salt, and butter to a boil in a pot (with a lid), then add grits while stirring constantly.Reduce heat and cook at a low simmer, covered, stirring frequently, until water is absorbed and grits are thickened, about 15 minutes.Stir in 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally to keep grits from sticking to bottom of pan, 10 minutes.Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and grits are thick and tender, about 35 minutes more.Once done, turn of heat and stir in the cheese. Cover until ready to use.After youve started the grits, now its time to marinate the shrimp.Shrimp Marinade:Combine all the ingredients for the marinade for the shrimp in a mixing bowl.Stir well and add the shrimp, gently stirring to coat.Place bowl in the refrigerator until ready to cook the shrimp. They will marinate about an hour.Green Onion Cilantro Sauce:Combine all of the ingredients above in a food processor.Pulse lightly until its a chunky sauce.Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.Tip: If you have an immersion blender, feel free to use it (thats what I did).Note: When the grits are about 10 minutes away from being done, you can start cooking the shrimp. Please make sure to have the onions and chipotle below chopped up before you start this step.SautedShrimp:Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat.Add the onions and chipotle and cook for 2-3 minutes until the onions are softened and the chipotle is fragrant.Add the shrimp and cook about 1 minute per side, trying to only flip once.Turn off the heat, cover the skillet and let the shrimp sit a moment until you are ready to plate up your dish.Final Step  Assembling the Dish:Its best to use large pasta bowls if you have them. Regular bowls work fine if not.Start byladling grits on the bottom of the bowl  if youre using pasta bowls, you can use about 1 1/2 cups of grits.Divvy up the shrimp next and also divide the pan sauce between the four bowls.Garnish each bowl liberally with green onion and cilantro sauce and a few sliced green onions.ENJOY!!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Stone Ground GritsBring water, salt, and butter to a boil in a pot (with a lid), then add grits while stirring constantly.Reduce heat and cook at a low simmer, covered, stirring frequently, until water is absorbed and grits are thickened, about 15 minutes.Stir in 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally to keep grits from sticking to bottom of pan, 10 minutes.Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and grits are thick and tender, about 35 minutes more.Once done, turn of heat and stir in the cheese.
