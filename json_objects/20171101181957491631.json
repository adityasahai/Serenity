Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Put them in a container (with a tight fitting lid).  Cover them with the apple cider vinegar.  Seal; shake to combine and set aside.  Periodically rotate the container.  Leave for 30 minutes.Prepare an ice water bath in a container large enough to hold the asparagus.  Set aside.Select a pot large enough to hold the asparagus; fill it with water and over high heat bring the water to a boil.  Add the butter, lemon juice and dill seed.  Allow the butter to melt and place the asparagus into the water until it’s firm but cooked; about 3-5 minutes.  Remove and promptly add to the ice water bath to stop the cooking process.  Remove after 2 minutes and wrap in paper towels or a clean kitchen towel to absorb extra water.Preparing the pear:  Rinse and dry the pear.  You may peel the pear if you choose (not required).  Slice the pear vertically into very thin slices; cut away any of the seeds or core present from the slices.Prepare four dining plates with 1 ½ cups arugula each.  Drain the quick-pickled beets and sprinkle evenly with one fourth of the beets per plate.  Add one fourth of the sliced carrots and pear to each plate.  Gently layer each plate with one fourth of the cooked asparagus spears.Making the Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette:  Meyer lemon olive oil has a bit of sweetness to it.  Normally I prefer ½ olive oil and ½ vinegar to my dressings but it’s personal as to how you like the taste.  I suggest mixing the Meyer Lemon Olive Oil and the White Balsamic Vinegar in a small jar.  Shake it up, taste it and balance with more olive oil or vinegar to meet your liking.  Salt and pepper to taste.Dress the prepared salad lightly, garnish with Lemon Thyme and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Peel and grate the beets.","ingredients":[{"id":11080,"name":"beet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beets.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Put them in a container (with a tight fitting lid).
