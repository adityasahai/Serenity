White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Start by preparing the chicken wings. Separate the wings at the joint and remove the tip. I like using kitchen shears for this, but a sharp chef's knife works well too. You can save the wings tips to use next time you make delicious homemade chicken broth:).Place the chicken wings in a steamer basket over 1-2 inches of water and steam for 10-15 minutes.This process with render off some of the fat from the chicken skin on the chicken wings, which is the first step to crispy wings.Place the steamed wings on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a paper towel on top of a cooking rack. Place in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Air drying the chicken will also promote crispiness. The dry skin will become crisp faster. During baking rendered fat and juices make the skin flabby and by first steaming the wings and then air drying, we resolved these problems.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Discard the paper towel under the cooking rack and replace with aluminum foil. Season the chicken wings with salt and pepper.Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, turn the chicken over and bake for another 20 minutes on the other side.When the chicken is almost done, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the garlic, cook just until it's beginning to send an aroma, about 30 seconds. Pour into a large bowl with ¼ teaspoon salt and hot sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by preparing the chicken wings.
