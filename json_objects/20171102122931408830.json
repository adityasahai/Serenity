Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"To make the remoulade dressing, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, red pepper sauce, garlic, green onion, and parsley. Taste and add salt if needed. To make the shrimp for the salad, bring a 3-quart saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the the shrimp and the salt. Cook the shrimp until pink, about 2 minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. To assemble the salad, in a large mixing bowl, toss the cooked shrimp with the lettuce, celery, and avocado. You can either serve the salad dressed by adding the remoulade to the mixing bowl and tossing, or you can evenly divide the salad onto 4 plates or into 4 bowls, and serve with the dressing on the side. I also like to serve the salad with lemon wedges for an added bit of brightness.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the remoulade dressing, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, red pepper sauce, garlic, green onion, and parsley.
