Place wakame in large bowl, and cover with warm water. Soak 10 minutes, then drain in colander, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Pull soaked wakame leaves apart, and spread on clean dish towel. Top with second dish towel, and press dry. Trim away any tough veins or stems with scissors, and stack wakame leaves. Roll stack tightly into cylinder, and transfer to cutting board. Cut cylinder into thin slices, and place in bowl.2. Peel cucumbers and carrot into thin strips, turning vegetables between every stroke of the vegetable peeler to keep strips from getting too wide. Add vegetable strips to wakame. Discard cucumber seeds.3. Whisk together vinegar, oil, and soy sauce in small bowl. Stir in red onion and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix vinegar mixture into wakame mixture with hands, separating strips and strands with fingers. Cover, and chill 15 minutes, or up to 2 hours.
