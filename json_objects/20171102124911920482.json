Try pairing with Bordeaux, White Burgundy, and Champagne. French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 103 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431104,"title":"Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend","description":"Raspberry and cherry with notes of violets lift from the glass and mingle with soft spice and toasted oak on the nose.
