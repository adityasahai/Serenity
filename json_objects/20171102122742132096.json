Add a spoonful or two of flour. You're going for a smooth consistency but with a little hold. (this helps when dipping everything). I usually start with about a tablespoon and then add about a ½ tablespoon more. Honestly, I've found that a single tablespoon is not always enough.In another bowl, combine the rest of your flour, pepper and the old Bay Seasoning. You can add whatever seasonings you want, but this simple combination has won my heart.Add your olive oil in a big frying pan and turn it on to med-high. You want to make sure that the pickles are almost covered. You'll flip them so being completely covered isn't important, but being mostly covered on the sides, is. P.S. You can use any oil you want, but I found that not only is Olive oil the healthier alternative, it seems to be the only oil that doesn't leave an oily aftertaste.Allow the oil to heat about 5 minutes. While this is happening, move onto the next step.Now come's the fun part! Take a pickle slice and dip it into the egg mixture. Now dredge it through the flour mixture, covering all sides as well as you can. Now, repeat. Re-dip it into the egg mixture - yes even with the flour already on it, and then dredge it back through the flour mixture again.Now, get ready because you're going to be working with hot oil. Gently place the pickle into the hot oil (this is where those tongs come in super handy) and allow to fry on one side until lightly browned. I think it took maybe 2-3 minutes, possibly less depending on how hot your oil actually is. Flip them and allow the to continue to cook about a minute until golden brown all over.When they are ready to be removed, place the fried pickles on a paper towel to absorb the extra oil. Allow to cool slightly (they are really hot for about the first 5 minutes).Serve with Homemade Buttermilk Ranch dressing. (I kid you not this is the best recipe I've had for Ranch Dressing and pairs absolutely perfectly with these little fried bites of awesome!) It does need to be made the night before so all the ingredients and flavors can marry each other. Yum!!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In one bowl, whisk together your eggs, the milk and the Worcestershire sauce.","ingredients":[{"id":6971,"name":"worcestershire sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add a spoonful or two of flour.
