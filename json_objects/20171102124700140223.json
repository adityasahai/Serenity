A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a separate large bowl, beat the sugar and butter with a stand or handheld mixer on medium speed until well blended - about 1 minute. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the mashed banana, yogurt, and vanilla. Continue beating until blended.Slowly stir in the flour mixture by hand, until *just combined* - do not overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips and then gently stir in the raspberries - you do not want the raspberries to bleed their color. You may sprinkle a few raspberries + chocolate chips on top for looks as well.The batter will be very thick, so spoon it into the prepared loaf pan rather than pouring it. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes in the pan on a wire rack.
