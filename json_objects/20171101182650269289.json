Keeping the food processor running add in the cold butter a couple pieces at a time and mix until its very crumbly and resembles sand. Stop the processor and scrape down the sides. Then pulse again while adding 1 TBSP of water at a time until the dough comes together. You may not need to you all the water.Remove the dough from the processor and knead slightly on a lightly floured surface (with gluten free flour). Divide into two balls and slighty flatten each into a disk. Wrap tightly into plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes.While the dough is chilling in a medium bowl combine the peach slices, blueberries and sliced basil. Add 2 TBSP of the peach syrup and stir gently to combine.When the dough is chilled, using only one at a time keeping the other chilled, lightly dust your surface with gluten free flour and roll out to a 10” circle. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Gently lift the dough and lay over one of the mini cast iron skillets allowing the edges to hang over the sides. Gently press the bottom of the dough into the skillet. Repeat with the other dough and skillet.Divide the peach mixture between the skillets and pour 1 TBSP of the remaining peach syrup over them. Fold the edges of the dough over part of the peach filling, overlapping each section to form a rough edge. If the dough tears a little that is fine, it is supposed to be more free-form than a pie. Brush the edges of the dough with 1 TBSP of peach syrup for each tart and sprinkle generously with the turbinado sugar. Place the skillets on a baking sheet and bake for 35 min. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving to allow the juices to settle, being careful as the skillet will remain hot, especially the handles. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.Rustic White Peach, Blueberry and Basil Skillet Galette www.PineappleandCoconut.comGalette dough Rrecipe adapted from America's Test KitchenPeel and slice the peach in half, remove the pit. Dice into 1” chunks. Place the peach chunks in a saucepan with the sugar and water and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lower the temperature and simmer for 10-15 min until the mixture starts to thicken, stirring occasionally and mashing the peaches against the side of the pan.
