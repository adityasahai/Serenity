If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

Place popcorn in a large bowl.In a small pot, combine honey, coconut oil or butter, cocoa powder, Mexican Chocolate Spice Mix (or combination of spices as per Note**), and salt over low heat, and stir until melted and smooth.Drizzle mixture over popped popcorn and gently stir until evenly coated. This may take a couple of minutes to ensure the glaze is evenly distributed.Spread popcorn into a single layer on prepared baking sheet.Bake for 5 minutes, remove from the oven and stir, then spread back out into a single layer.Return to the oven and bake in 3 minute intervals, stirring each time until the popcorn is nearly dry. You will probably need two or three more 3 minute intervals. Be careful to avoid burning the popcorn.Allow to cool completely. Popcorn will continue to harden as it cools. Store in an airtight container, if it lasts that long.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325°F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place popcorn in a large bowl.In a small pot, combine honey, coconut oil or butter, cocoa powder, Mexican Chocolate Spice","ingredients":[{"id":19165,"name":"cocoa powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg"},{"id":4047,"name":"coconut oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oil-coconut.jpg"},{"id":19034,"name":"popcorn","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/popcorn.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix (or combination of spices as per Note**), and salt over low heat, and stir until melted and smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Drizzle mixture over popped popcorn and gently stir until evenly coated.
