A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350째F (180째C). Butter a 9-inch square baking pan with 2-inch sides and line the bottom with a piece of parchment paper long enough to extend over the opposite sides of the pan. Butter the paper.2. Place the chocolates, butter, and dissolved coffee in a heatproof bowl (or the top of a double boiler) and place it over, but not touching, barely simmering water in a saucepan (or the bottom of the double boiler). Stir until the chocolates and butter are melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.3. In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla until fluffy and lightened in color, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the melted chocolate mixture until blended. Add the flour and mix just until no white streaks remain. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.4. Bake until the top of the cake is shiny and firm and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, about 35 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 1 hour.5. If using the ganache, pour it over the cake, tilting the pan to spread it evenly. Cool the cake in the pan completely. If omitting the glaze, dust the cooled cake with powdered sugar.6. Use the overhanging ends of parchment paper to lift the cake from the pan. Serve the cake at room temperature with scoops of ice cream. The cake can be covered and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position a rack in the middle of the oven.
