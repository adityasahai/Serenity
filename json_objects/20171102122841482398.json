Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Mix in egg and vanilla, followed by sea salt, baking powder, baking soda and flour. Continue mixing, increasing speed as needed, until no streaks remain and all ingredients are incorporated well.

Using a medium cookie scoop, place cookie dough balls 2-inches apart on a silicone lined baking sheet. Bake cookies for 13-15 minutes or until lightly golden around the edge.
