Try pairing with Sparkling Wine. Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Moet & Chandon Nectar Imperial with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 56 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":466285,"title":"Moet & Chandon Nectar Imperial","description":"Nectar Impérial is the boldest and most unexpected Moët & Chandon champagne.
