A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Cover and cook on high heat just until chard is wilted (the chard should be tender but not overcooked so watch it carefully). When the chard is done, place in a collander to cool and drain.Cover the thinly sliced basil leaves with two tablespoons of the boiling water and set aside.Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. In a larger bowl, mix together ricotta, Parmesan, milk and eggs until blended.  Add the oil, basil, and whisk in the flour mixter.  Return to the chard and squeeze out as much water as possible, then chop it finely.  Stir the chopped chard into the mixture.Heat a few tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Drop the batter by the spoonfuls into the hot pan, making whatever size cake you wish. The batter is quite thick so you must give it plenty of time to cook through (about 3 minutes per side or longer). They should be golden brown.  Only turn the cakes once and resist the urge to pat them down.Remove the cakes from the pan and serve warm with a dollop of thick yogurt and some fresh basil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Wash and drain the chard, then place in a pot of boiling water.
