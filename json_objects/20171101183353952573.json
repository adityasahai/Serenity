Place turkey breasts in brine and place in refrigerator for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While turkey is brining, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sautee until softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Place onions in a large bowl along with cornbread, cranberries, chicken stock, pecans, sage, 1 teaspoon of salt, and black pepper. Mix to thoroughly combine.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Remove turkey breasts from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Butterfly turkey breasts open and pound out to a rectangle of even thickness. Spread half of the stuffing in an even thickness over each of the breasts, leaving about 1/2 an inch edge with no stuffing. Starting with the long end of the turkey breast, roll tightly into a cylinder. Tie closed with butchers twine about every 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Season turkey breasts all over with salt and pepper and brush lightly with olive oil.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover gill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Sear turkey breasts over hot side of grill until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Move turkey to cool side of the grill, cover, and cook until an instant read thermometer reads 165 degrees when inserted into the center of the turkey. Remove from grill, let stand for 15 minutes. Slice turkey between each piece of twine, remove twine, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"To make the brine, combine water, salt, and sugar in a large bowl and whisk to dissolve.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place turkey breasts in brine and place in refrigerator for 1 hour.","ingredients":[{"id":5696,"name":"turkey breast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turkey-breast.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"2","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"While turkey is brining, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Add onions and sautee until softened, about 5 to 7 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Place onions in a large bowl along with cornbread, cranberries, chicken stock, pecans, sage, 1 teaspoon of salt, and black pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":6172,"name":"chicken stock","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"black pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":18023,"name":"cornbread","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornbread.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":12142,"name":"pecans","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg"},{"id":2038,"name":"sage","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sage.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":8,"step":"Mix to thoroughly combine.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":9,"step":"3","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":10,"step":"Remove turkey breasts from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
