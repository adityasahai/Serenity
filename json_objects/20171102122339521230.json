Divide puff pastry into 2 pieces and roll each piece into a 9- by 11-inch rectangle. Place 1 rectangle on a lined baking sheet, then place the filling in the center of the pie leaving a 1 inch border. Brush the border with beaten egg, then place the remaining sheet of pastry on top. Pinch the edges closed, then brush the edges with egg and fold each edge over. Brush the rest of the pie with egg. With the tip of a knife, make two holes for the center for the steam to escape, Gently score the top of the pie. Bake until pie is golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large pot, combine chicken leg pieces, onion, parsley, 1/2 bunch thyme, and 3 sage leaves, and cover with water.
