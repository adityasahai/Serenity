Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Warm olive oil and butter in medium-sized skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic, and cook slowly until garlic is      fragrant and just starting to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in parsley and toasted walnuts, and keep warm over very low heat.  Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place tagliatelle into water, and cook according to package directions. Drain, and toss pasta gently with warmed olive oil mixture. Add Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and generous grindings of black pepper, and toss until strands are well coated. Serve immediately in warmed pasta bowls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Warm olive oil and butter in medium-sized skillet over medium-low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add garlic, and cook slowly until garlic is","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"fragrant and just starting to turn golden, about 10 minutes.
