Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 56 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":445451,"title":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"Shows dark plum/garnet with some amber and orange at the edge. The nose shows roasted herbs and meatiness with some background notes of sweet cherry, truffle and vegetal qualities. This is a distinctive Pinot Noir with aromatics that are very old-world. In the mouth the wine has always had a certain austerity but a bit of a gap in the middle. The wine has held up nicely over time but has never really developed the sweetness and charm that we would expect of our best Pinot Noirs.","price":"$55.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445451-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/beaux-freres-the-beaux-freres-vineyard-pinot-noir-1996/126352"}]},"instructions":"1                               Heat oven to 450°F.
