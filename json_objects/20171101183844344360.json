The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Madsen Family Cellars Sangiovese Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431618,"title":"Madsen Family Cellars Sangiovese Wine","description":"This wine has a pronounced nose with a hint of coffee while your mouth is invaded with spices; clove, licorice, and cinnamon.The palate features cherries and notes of clove which continue on to a smooth, long finish with subtle oak, slight pepper and berry flavors. The tartness of the wine works well with food as Sangiovese is a food wine, but can be enjoyed on its own as well.
