A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

These will become your edible cupcake liner, so be sure it is thick enough that it will not break. Place chocolate coated muffin liners in a mini muffin tin, and place in the freezer for 20 minutes.With the remaining melted chocolate, we will make chocolate curls to decorate our cupcakes. Using an offset spatula, spread the chocolate in a thin layer on the back of a metal baking sheet. Draw lines where you want the curls to naturally break once the chocolate has cooled slightly. Set the chocolate aside, but keep an eye on it. Once it is no longer shiny, use the back of a metal spatula at about 45 degrees to the pan, scrape the chocolate off the back of the pan, creating curls. NOTE: A thick plastic spatula will not work.In a mixing bowl, or stand mixer, combine the softened cream cheese, sugar and peanut butter until smooth.Using a rubber spatula, stir half of the whipped cream into the cream cheese/peanut butter mixture. Now carefully fold in the second half of the whipped cream.Once the chocolate cupcake liners have set up in the freezer, remove one at a time, and carefully tear the paper liner away from the chocolate. Place chocolate cupcake liner back in the fridge or freezer until ready to use. Repeat until all 12 are complete.Using either 2 small spoons, or a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip, fill the chocolate cupcake liners with the cream cheese/peanut butter/whipped cream mixture. Mound the filling, making them look like little cupcakes. Top with a chocolate curl.Serve immediately, or keep refrigerated until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Using the back of a spoon, or a small pastry brush, coat the inside of 12 mini-muffin liners with the melted chocolate, being sure to coat the sides & the bottom.
