Add the butter and pulse 5-6 times, until there are no pieces of butter bigger than peas.In another bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients. Pour into the food processor, and pulse together until it forms a dough. Cut into 4 equal-sized pieces, and form into balls. Pat down into a disc shape, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.While the dough is chilling, blend together the mascarpone, lemon juice, and ¼ teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender. Taste and add more salt if you'd like.Turn on your grill, and heat to 375 degrees. Preheat your pizza stone on your grill.Place the dough balls on a piece of parchment, and roll each into a 6-inch circle. Brush ½ teaspoon of olive oil on each circle, then top with ¼ of the mascarpone, and a couple slices of tomato. Fold up the sides of the galette, and then drizzle with another ½ teaspoon of olive oil. Brush it on so it coats the sides of the dough. Sprinkle a little kosher salt and pepper on top of the galettes.Place the parchment on the heated pizza stone, and cover the grill. Grill for 25-30 minutes, until the dough is golden and the tomatoes look roasted. Check the grill often to ensure it's staying around 370-380 degrees.Serve warm with sliced fresh basil on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pulse together the flour and salt in a food processor.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butter and pulse 5-6 times, until there are no pieces of butter bigger than peas.In another bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour into the food processor, and pulse together until it forms a dough.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Cut into 4 equal-sized pieces, and form into balls.
