Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Blend the mixture at high speed until completely smooth and no bits of nuts remain. If you dont have a big blender, blend the mixture in two batches.Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring the sauce to a simmer,whisking continuously. Once the mixture comes to a simmer, reduce the heat slightly and cook, whiskingcontinuously until thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes. Tip: Use a good-tasting unsweetened soymilk for this sauce, as the flavor really comes through. If youre using a high-speed blender, you can skip the soaking step for the cashews and just use them dry. Add alittle extra water to blend if needed.For the florentine:Preheat the oven to 400F. Grease an 8-inch square glass or ceramic baking dish.In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Dont overcook the pasta, especially if youre using one that is gluten-free. Drain the pasta well and transfer to a large bowl.Drain most of the liquid out of the spinach by gently squeezing it, but dont squeeze it completely dry. Add the spinach to the pasta, along with the sauce, mixing until the pasta is thickly coated. Add the sherry, Dijon mustard, nutritional yeast, granulated onion, and nutmeg, stirring well. Add salt and pepper, and adjust seasonings to taste. Scoop the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until hot and slightly bubbly around the edges. Remove from the oven and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the almost alfredo sauce:In the jar of a blender, combine the soymilk, water, cashews, nutritional yeast, oat flour, cornstarch, salt, and granulated onion.
