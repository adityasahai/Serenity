Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Take all the ingredients except olive (parsley, cilantro, garlic, walnuts, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, lemon juice) in the food processor. Pulse it couple of times, also scrape down the sides using spatula.While food processor is running, slowly add olive oil through tube. Oil should not be separated and your pesto is ready.This quantity makes about 1 cup of pesto, we are using  cup in pasta and I freeze rest for later use.Take large saucepan or patila, add enough water and bring it to a rolling boil on high heat. Add big pinch of salt and pasta. Stir once and Let pasta cook till al dente (cooking time should be mentioned on the pasta box.). Drain all the water and keep it aside.Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot saute green chili for few seconds. Then mix in chopped onions with some salt. Be careful, pasta and pesto both have already salt in it. Let onions get translucent.
