Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Selvapiana Chianti Rufina. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436167,"title":"Selvapiana Chianti Rufina","description":"This is a big and juicy Chianti Rufina, offering delicious strawberry and cherry aromas followed by subtle notes of spice box, leather, earth and mushrooms. Dense, smooth and medium-bodied, with great concentration and fine tannins.Easy-going and supple, this is great food wine: ideal for rich pastas, creamy soups, barbecued meats and cheeses.","price":"$14.09","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436167-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/selvapiana-chianti-rufina-2007/98486"}]},"instructions":"Several hours (or days) ahead of time, put the whole cherries in a medium saucepan. No need to pit them (unless you so desire) because we'll be straining out the pits later. Pull the petals off the roses and add to the pan. Add the water and sugar and stir. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes or until the syrup is a beautiful rosy cherry color and smells totally intoxicating.Let the syrup cool, then strain through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer into a bottle. Squeeze the cherries well to squeeze all the juice out of them. Keep the syrup in a covered bottle or jar in the fridge.When it's time to make the sodas, take a tall glass and add a bunch of ice cubes. Pour the club soda in, then add a shot of the cherry syrup. Stir to mix up the syrup in the soda, then slowly pour a shot of the half & half on top, watching the wonderful swirls that the cream makes in the soda.Garnish with a cherry ... let the guests stir & enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Several hours (or days) ahead of time, put the whole cherries in a medium saucepan.
