parsley, mustard, celery seed, mustard seed and garlic. Tenderize the pork loin by placing on a cutting board. Take two forks with both hands and simultaneously jab the fork into the loin multiple times to pierce. Place pork loin roast in a large plastic re-sealable bag and pour marinade over pork loin. Seal and marinate in refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Remove roast from bag, place in a roasting pan, and save marinade. Roast pork loin at 325 degrees F for about 1 14 hours, or to an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. Baste the pork with the marinade every 30 minutes while cooking. Remove roast from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes (it will continue to cook during this resting stage). Confirm internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F prior to serving.
