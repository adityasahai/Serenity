A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Sprinkle in the gelatin and whisk until incorporated. Let stand for 10 minutes so the gelatin can \"bloom.\" Set the saucepan over medium-high heat. Warm the coconut milk, stirring constantly, until it starts to steam and the gelatin appears to be fully dissolved. Do not bring to a boil - you just want the milk to heat to the point where the mixture is smooth. Off the heat, whisk in the syrup and vanilla. Carefully pour the mixture into 4 ramekins or custard cups (I transferred mine first to a 4-cup measure to make pouring easier. Some people recommend straining through a sieve, but I found that my mixture was plenty smooth without this step). Refrigerate for the panna cotta for at least 5 hours, or overnight. When ready to serve, divide the compote between the ramekins and garnish with the strawberries.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, whisk the coconut milk until smooth.
