with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color.

Toss, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to brine. Toss in the parsley right before adding the dressing.                          Into a jar, add the mayonnaise, Dijon, poppy seeds, lemon juice, lime juice, the remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and lots of freshly cracked pepper. Close the jar and shake until well mixed. Pour the dressing onto the slaw and toss to combine.                          To make the tuna-cakes sliders: Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Throw in the celery, chile, garlic, cayenne, celery seeds, salt and freshly cracked pepper and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.                          In a big bowl, add the tuna, breadcrumbs, parsley, cream, Dijon, green onions and egg, and mix. Add the cooled garlic-chile mixture and mix again.                          Lightly flour your hands and shape the tuna mixture into small patties. Dredge them in flour and then place in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up.                          Heat the canola oil to 350 degrees F in a large frying pan. Fry until crispy and heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.
