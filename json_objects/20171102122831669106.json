Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Piper-Heidsieck Brut Cuvee with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":450714,"title":"Piper-Heidsieck Brut Cuvee","description":"Piper-Heidsieck Cuvée Brut is a classic, structured, full-bodied and bursting with fruit Champagne.
