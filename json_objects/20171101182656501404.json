Try pairing with Sparkling Wine. Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Billecart-Salmon Brut ros√© ( Magnum). Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 170 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":457927,"title":"Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose ( Magnum)","description":"Persistent mousse, with fine bubbles rising slowly.
