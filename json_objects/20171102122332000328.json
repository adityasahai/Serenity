Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":433920,"title":"Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir","description":"The Willamette Valley is best known for their rich Pinot Noir and this is one of the biggest and richest ever from Argyle! Take the color and scent of a Guinee rose, add fruit aromas of black cherry and marion berry with spice aromas of turned earth and dark cocoa and you just begin to approach the complexity of this wine. \"Ripe and generous, with distinctive violet and rose petal overtones to the cherry and spice flavors, lingering with fine texture. Needs time to settle in. Twenty percent of the wine will be bottled under screw cap. The wine bottled under screw cap scored 92 points.
