Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, salt, pepper, and stock in a large pot or skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium/medium high so that mixture continues to maintain a slow boil.
