A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.2. Melt the semisweet chocolate over a double boiler (or in 30-second intervals in the microwave on 50% power, stirring after each).  Spread the chocolate mixture onto the prepared pan in an even layer (depending on the size of the pan and how thick you’d like your bark, you may not need the entire surface of the pan). Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until set.3. Melt the white chocolate over a double boiler (or in 30-second intervals in the microwave on 50% power, stirring after each). Whisk the cake mix into the melted white chocolate until it's smooth and no lumps remain. Let it sit for about 3 minutes to thicken slightly.4. Remove the pan of semisweet chocolate from the refrigerator and pour the white chocolate over top. Use an offset spatula to spread the white chocolate evenly over the chocolate below. Immediately sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles on the surface of the white chocolate. Return the pan to the refrigerator and allow to set for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour. Once set, use a sharp knife to cut into pieces or break apart. Store the bark in an airtight container in the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.2.
