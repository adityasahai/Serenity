A Gewürztraminer will be great with your basic New York style hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. For a Chicago-style dog with sour pickles and hot peppers, you might opt for a crisp Riesling. No matter your toppings, a dry rosé almost always works. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":443227,"title":"Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling","description":"The Chateau Ste.
