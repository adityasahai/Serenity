Use clean fingers or a paper towel coat the inside of a 2 ½ quart casserole dish with 1 ½ tablespoons of butter.In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the heavy cream, thyme, and bay leaves until the mixture just simmers (don’t allow it to boil). Remove the pan from the heat and set aside, allowing the flavors of the thyme and the bay to infuse the cream as it sits.As the cream is heating up, melt the remaining 1 ½ tablespoons of butter in a sauté pan over medium high heat. Once the butter is melted, add the diced onion and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, and allow the mixture to cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the minced garlic and sauté 3-4 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Use the thinnest option on a mandoline slicer to cut the potatoes into 1/16 inch slices. If you do not have a mandoline, use a sharp knife to slice the potatoes as evenly and thinly as possible (it will be difficult to get the slices any thinner than 1/8 inch if cutting by hand, but that’s okay!). Two and a half pounds of sliced potatoes should yield about 8 cups.In a large mixing bowl, add the potato slices, sautéed onions and garlic, grated parmesan, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and pepper. Pour the infused cream through a fine mesh strainer into the bowl, discarding the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Use a wooden spoon to gently toss together the ingredients until combined.Arrange the potato slices in even layers in the prepared casserole dish. Pour any remaining cream mixture over the potatoes and finish with a sprinkle of fresh thyme leaves (about ½ teaspoon).Cover with foil and bake until the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Then, remove the foil and cook for 10 minutes more until the top of the potatoes are golden. Let the gratin rest for 15 to 20 minutes before serving to allow the cream sauce to set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
