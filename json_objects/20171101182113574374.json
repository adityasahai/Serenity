Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":442701,"title":"Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico","description":"Ruby red with garnet hues. The wine expresses a distinctive Tuscan bouquet of violet, cherry, and plum, with aromas of chocolate and spice. Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, cherry, and ripe plum with intriguing notes of cinnamon and clove. Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. Itâ€™s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011/166890"}]},"instructions":"Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a deep ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and wipe out the skillet.                          Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat; add the flour and cook, whisking, 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk and chicken broth until smooth; simmer, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 1/2 teaspoon salt and the nutmeg.                          Add the chicken, mushrooms, gnocchi and spinach to the sauce and stir until coated and the spinach wilts. Sprinkle with the parmesan, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until bubbling, about 20 minutes. Turn on the broiler; broil until lightly browned on top, about 3 more minutes.
