A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Add it to the bowl and stir/fold with a sturdy spatula until just combined (Careful not to overwork the dough! That will make your shortcakes tough instead of tender.).Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead it into a ball. Pat the ball out to about  thick. Cut the dough using a small biscuit cutter (OR whatever you have handy). The size is really your preference but larger will change the bake time. Pictured here are 3\" circles. Place your shortcake cut-outs onto an ungreased baking sheet about an inch apart.Brush the tops of the shortcakes with the beaten egg white and then sprinkle with sugar.Bake for about 10 minutes (more for larger shortcakes) - the bottoms will lightly brown and the tops will be golden from the egg wash. Remove them from the baking sheet, and let them cool completely.To make the apple topping add the chopped apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, and bourbon to a medium saucepan. Stir the mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until apples are softened but not mushy - about 13 minutes.To make the bourbon caramel, pour the water in a small saucepan. Add the sugar in a little pile right in the center of the pan. Turn the heat up to medium high, cover and simmer (this will only take about 30 seconds). Remove the lid and let it continue to simmer for about 12 minutes. Sometimes it takes longer. You are looking for that pretty amber caramel color. Place the pan in the sink, add a tablespoon of the cream and stir it in. It will bubble and sizzle. Keep stirring until it's smooth. Stir in the vanilla and bourbon. If it seems too thick add more cream. You want it to still be sort of saucy as it cools (but I serve this caramel warm because it is DELICIOUS.).To make fresh whipped cream, beat the heavy cream and powdered sugar together using the whisk attachment on a stand or hand mixer until stiff peaks form.To assemble the shortcakes, place 1-2 shortcakes on each plate. Top with the apple mixture. add whipped cream. Drizzle with the bourbon caramel.
