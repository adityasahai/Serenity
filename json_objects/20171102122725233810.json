Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C).Make the pastry2. Put the flour, baking powder, and about 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and stir with a fork. Drop in the butter and cut it into the flour until the butter pieces are about the size of small peas. Do this with a pastry blender, two knives, or your fingers. Pour in the milk and stir until you have a dough that hasn’t quite come together. Dump it on the counter and knead it a few times to work in the dry flour.3. Divide the dough in half. Roll one half out until it is large enough to line a 10-inch pie plate. The other half can sit unless the kitchen is hot. If it is, refrigerate the dough (or work fast).Make the tomato filling4. Mix the tomatoes with the herbs, half the cheddar, and some salt. Pat this out evenly in the pastry. Spread the tomatoes with the mayo and scatter the rest of the cheese on top.5. Roll out the rest of the biscuit dough, and top the pie. Trim the top and bottom crusts back to the rim of the pie plate, leaving no overhang. You can seal the crusts with either a fork or your fingers.6. Bake the tomato pie until it’s golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Let it cool for a while before serving. It wants to be warm, not hot.7. You can reheat slices in the microwave. Or in the oven, fellow Luddites.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C).Make the pastry2.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the flour, baking powder, and about 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and stir with a fork.
