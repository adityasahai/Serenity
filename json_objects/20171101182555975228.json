are great choices for Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

But let me tell you, a good drizzle of this dressing adds whole new layer of yum factor. This is my first time having this sweet tahini dressing and I was amazed at how good it tasted. It's a wonderful creamy sweet dressing that so easy to make. The sesame paste isn't bitter here at all and mixes very well with sweetness. It would make for a nice twist on the Waldorf Salad. Yes, more ways to use tahini! I am now officially addicted to this new find. I also found myself using it as a dip for sliced apples. So good...better than caramel with apples I think! It has a unique flavor that I cannot explain, it is something you must experience for yourself if you haven't already.As for the salad, you can make it in one pot and uses common ingredients so you can whip this up anytime. You can also add/subtract ingredients to suit what you have on hand or to suit your taste. I love versatility and this salad allows for that. I know you will be fond of this combination and hope you put it on your must try list. It's a nice fruit fall salad...and a keeper!Lot's of flavor, texture and simple deliciousness in every bite. And, it's 100% percent good for you!APPLE HARVEST QUINOA SALAD + SWEET TAHINI DRESSINGIngredients1 cup quinoa (I used tri-color)1 3/4 cup water1 lemon, juice of2 large apples, cored and diced (1 green + 1 redpref.)1 1/2 cup grapes, sliced in half (I used red & green)1 stalk celery, thinly sliced1/4 cup raisinshandful chopped almondsa few large mint leaves, julienned1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, or to tasteSweet Tahini Dressing1/3 cup tahini1/4 cup water2 tablespoons pure maple syrup1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar, or to taste (optional)Rinse your quinoa in a fine mesh sieve. In a medium size pot, add water and quinoa, bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove cover and let set 15 minutes, fluff with a fork.While quinoa is cooking, prepare your dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside to let the flavors relax into each other. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to thin as needed. To thicken add more tahini. It should be thin enough to drizzle. Dressing serves four.Core and dice apples, top with lemon juice and toss gently (I did this right on the cutting board to not dirty up another bowl).Prepare the remaining ingredients. Add the apples, grapes, celery, raisins, almonds, mint leaves and cinnamon to the quinoa, mix well. Taste for flavor adding more cinnamon if you like.Spoon into serving dishes and serve with a good drizzle of the sweet tahini dressing. Serves 4 - 6Notes:I used 1 granny smith and 1 fuji apple. Feel free to use your favorite apples.This recipe is just a template...feel free to sub in unsweetened cranberries for the raisins (I use raisins because they contain no added sugars and I can find organic ones easily). Opt to leave the celery or grapes out using just apples (or use any combo you like). Add in a grated carrot for more color. Add more cinnamon if you like. Try using pecans instead of almonds. Try serving with some leafy greens. Have fun playing around with this making it your own.Store at room temperature if eating within a few hours or store in the refrigerator until ready.Enjoy!Did you make any changes or have suggestions that others might find helpful?Please share your experience with us. :)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"A little sweet, a little tart and a then a little more sweet...this quinoa salad is a wonderful mix of flavors and sensations.And then if it couldn't get any better, in comes the sweet tahini dressing...Without the dressing this salad can stand alone, especially with a nice hint of the cinnamon.
