To make the caramel, add the sugar in an even layer to the bottom of a medium saucepan.2. Heat sugar on medium-high and whisk until the sugar has melted, about 5 minutes. The sugar will lump together, but eventually melt.3. Continue whisking until the temperature reaches 350 degrees or the sugar has turned an amber color. It will reach 350 degrees very quickly after all the sugar has melted. Watch it very closely. It goes from nice caramel to burned very quickly.4. Remove caramel from heat and add butter. Whisk until melted and combined. Mixture might bubble a bit.5. Add the heavy cream and whisk until incorporated.6. Cool caramel to room temperature.7. To make the apples, combine apples, lemon juice, nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar in a medium pan and toss to coat.8. Add butter and cook apples for about 15-20 minutes, or until at preferred softness.9. Allow to cool for 15-20 minutes.10. To make cinnamon whipped cream, freeze a metal bowl and whisk attachment for 10-15 minutes.11. Remove bowl from freezer, add heavy whipping cream, and whip on high speed until it begins to thicken.12. Add powdered sugar and cinnamon and whip until it you get stiff peaks.13. Once everything is made a ready, build the trifles.14. Pipe an even layer of whipped cream into the bottom of the cup or jar you are using.15. Add about 2 tbsp granola in an even layer.16.
