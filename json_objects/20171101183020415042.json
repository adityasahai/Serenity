Add in the shallots and saute until they start to become translucent. Add the mushrooms and thyme to skillet.  Stir and cook until mushrooms are no longer raw and most of the moisture is absorbed.

Followed by 1/4 of the cheeses, then 1/4th of the egg mixture and repeat layers until all ingredients are used up. Bake quiches on a baking pan in oven for 40 - 45 minutes or until set.
