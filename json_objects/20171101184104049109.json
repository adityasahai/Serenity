The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 Â°C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"1. Preheat oven to 450 and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Toss tomatoes with olive oil and roast for 10 minutes until soft and blistered.  Remove from oven and set aside.2. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until flour is slightly brown, about 3-5 minutes3. Pour in milk, whisking constantly until mixture is smooth. Stir until boiling and then reduce heat to low. Simmer until mixture thickens a little, about 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes.4. Meanwhile, cook pasta until al dente, drain and return to pot. Remove sauce from heat, whisk in cheese and stir until cheese is melted. Add pasta and stir to coat. Cool for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.5. Ladle a generous amount of mac and cheese over the pizza crust (you won't use all of it, meaning you will have leftover mac and cheese, meaning you will be SO happy later in the week!).  Scatter the roasted tomatoes on top, and shake on some oregano.6. Bake for 5-10 minutes, remove from oven, cut into wedges with pizza cutter and serve!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 450 and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
