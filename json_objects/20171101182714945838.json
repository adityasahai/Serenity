A light and crisp sparkling rosé complements fluffy angel food cake - even more so if you're serving it with strawberries. Of course a sweet sparkling white wine will work too. One wine you could try is Bellissima Sparkling rosé. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam. Uncorked at the very last minute, Bellissima Sparkling Rosé pairs perfectly with smoked salmon, shellfish, and seafood hor d’oeuvres such as tuna tartare, sushi, and sashimi.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/458665-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bellissima-sparkling-rose/293794"}]},"instructions":"Prepare the angel food cake as directed on the package. Let cool. With a serrated knife, cut it into three even layers.Prepare mousse. Put boiling water in a mixing bowl. Add the coffee and stir to dissolve. Add the marshmallow crème and beat on low until blended and smooth. Fold in the whipped topping.Line a 9 inch round springform pan with foil and place the first layer of your angel food cake in the pan. You may have to squish it in a bit. Spread about 1/2 of the mocha mousse over the cake. Top with second layer of cake. Add remaining mocha mousse. Top with remaining layer of angel food cake. Put plastic wrap over the cake and put the whole thing in the freeze for about 3 hours or until frozen.As soon as you put the cake in the freezer, go ahead and start preparing the chocolate whipped cream since the chocolate mixture requires some chill time too.Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, milk, coffee powder and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour or up to 4.Set the stand mixer bowl back on the mixer and with the whisk attachment, beat on medium, gradually adding the cream. Continue beating, increasing speed slightly, until stiff peaks begin form — be careful not to overdo it.Remove frozen cake from freezer and unlatch sides of pan. Peel away foil and set frozen cake on a cake tray. Spread chocolate whipped cream over entire cake. You’ll have plenty of chocolate whipped cream and possible even a little left over. Store cake in the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the angel food cake as directed on the package.","ingredients":[{"id":18088,"name":"angel food cake","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/angel-food-cake.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Let cool.
