Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437917,"title":"Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon 2009 is deep crimson red in color. The nose is complex with ripe blackcurrant cassis and red cherry fruit anchored by attractive base notes of oak, earthiness and a wisp of woodsmoke. The wine attacks with bright fleshy cherry fruit built upon by layers of leaf and leather. The finish is mouthfilling and lingering and the tannins giving persistent flesh and presence.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437917-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ringbolt-cabernet-sauvignon-2009/112598"}]},"instructions":"I used my 4-Quart slow cooker.In your slow cooker, combine the potato, sweet potato, carrots, parsnip, onion, sausages, tomatoes (with their juices), broth, sugar, thyme and pepper.Stir well to mix.Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 9 hours or on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours, or until the vegetables are tender and can easily be pierced with a fork.Stir in the parsley during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking.Season to taste with salt and pepper.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"I used my 4-Quart slow cooker.In your slow cooker, combine the potato, sweet potato, carrots, parsnip, onion, sausages, tomatoes (with their juices), broth, sugar, thyme and pepper.Stir well to mix.Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 9 hours or on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours, or until the vegetables are tender and can easily be pierced with a fork.Stir in the parsley during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking.Season to taste with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":11507,"name":"sweet potato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg"},{"id":11298,"name":"parsnip","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsnip.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":11362,"name":"potato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/potatoes-yukon-gold.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
