for Chicken Chili. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better.

Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a plate and allow to cook. Shred the chicken using the shredding attachment blade on a food processor, or with two forks.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a large soup pot or dutch oven. Cook the onions and bell peppers for about 8 minutes, until softened. Add the chipotle peppers and seasonings; cook for another minute while stirring. Add the cannellini beans, diced green chilis, corn, chicken broth, adobo sauce and shredded chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes, to allow flavors to blend. Or, simmer for longer - the flavor will get even better with more time.Finish by squeezing in the lime juice just before serving. Garnish with plain yogurt or light sour cream, shredded cheese, and chopped scallions or cilantro, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the chicken breasts a in a deep saute pan or saucepan.","ingredients":[{"id":5062,"name":"chicken breast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add enough water to cover.
