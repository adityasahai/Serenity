Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

(Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper if you don't have a whoopie pie pan and lightly grease it.)Beat the butter and sugar on medium heat until creamy. Beat in the vanilla.Beat in the eggs, one at a time.Add flour, baking soda and salt, mix until just combined.Add the oats, mix until just combined.Fold in the chopped caramels and chopped apples until evenly spread throughout the dough. Scoop the dough (#16 scoop or about 1/4 cup) onto the pan. (About 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.)Bake for 9 to 11 minutes.Let the cookies set in the pan for a couple of minutes. Be careful taking out the cookies as the caramel gets sticky. Line the cooling rack with parchment paper and very lightly grease it. (It will be easier to pick up the cookies as the caramel gets sticky.) Transfer the cookies onto the cooling rack. Cool the cookies.Place Dulce de Leche in the piping bag with a #4 attachment and drizzle it onto the cookies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"~Preheat the oven to 350 and grease a whoopie pie pan.
