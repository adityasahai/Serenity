A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

It will become a thick paste. Leave at room temperature for a couple of minutes (5-7) until the mixture foams and have the consistency of a sponge. Add the orange peel, salt, honey/maple syrup, vegetable oil and orange juice. With the dough hook on start mixing slowly adding 3 1/2 cups bread flour. The dough should clean itself from the sides of the bowl, will be elastic and very smooth. In a separate bowl mix the frozen cranberries with 1 tbsp flour, making sure they are well coated. Take the dough out of the bowl, place it on a working area, flatten it with your fingers and add the cranberries on top of it. With your hands, start kneading the dough until all the cranberries are incorporated. Place the dough ball into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let at room temperature until doubled in volume. Punch it down and shape it into a log. Place it into a greased bread pan (2 pound bread pan), cover and let rise again. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 375F. Bake the bread in preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes. Let cool slightly in the bread pan before removing it. Slice and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup bread flour with yeast and lukewarm water. It will become a thick paste.
