Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"To make dough: Stir together 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, salt and rosemary in a large mixing bowl. Combine warm water, honey and oil in a small saucepan. Heat until warm to the touch (120 to 130F). With a wooden spoon, gradually stir the liquid into the flour mixture. Stir vigorously until well mixed. Gradually work in the remaining 1/4 cup flour to make a firm, soft, smooth dough.Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding additional flour as needed to prevent it from sticking. (Alternatively, combine all the flour with the yeast, salt and rosemary in a food processor. With the motor running, add the heated liquid ingredients and process until the dough forms a ball. Process for 1 minute to knead.)Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.Preheat oven to 450F. Lightly spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and dust lightly with cornmeal.To make topping and bake focaccia: Heat oil over medium heat in a small nonstick skillet. Add onions and rosemary; saut until the onions are light golden, about 5 minutes. Add water and simmer until all the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Let cool.Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and, with floured hands, form the dough into a rectangular shape. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and press dough to cover the baking sheet. Brush egg white over the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the reserved onion mixture over the surface. Top with kosher salt and pepper. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 8 or 16 pieces.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make dough: Stir together 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, salt and rosemary in a large mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine warm water, honey and oil in a small saucepan.","ingredients":[{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat until warm to the touch (120 to 130F).
