Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Special equipment: One 10-inch wooden skewer              Combine half of the shrimp, 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper in the bowl of a food processor and process until mostly smooth. Add the remaining shrimp and pulse until the shrimp is mostly chopped into large pieces. Carefully transfer the shrimp mixture onto a parchment-paper-lined sheet tray. Wet your hands and lightly form the shrimp mixture into a disc (wetting your hands will prevent the shrimp mixture from sticking to them). Divide the disc into 4 equal amounts. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 sausages or \"shrimp dogs\" approximately 6 inches long and 1 inch wide, wetting your hands as needed. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the grilled vegetable relish.                          Prepare a grill or large grill pan for medium-high heat. Thread the tomatoes onto the wooden skewer, leaving only 1/2 inch of the skewer revealed on each end. (This prevents the skewer from having to be soaked in water before grilling.) Put the skewered tomatoes onto a baking sheet along with the onions and pickle slices. Brush all of the vegetables liberally with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.                          Lightly oil the grill grates. Arrange the skewered tomatoes, onions, and pickle slices on the hot grill. Cook until the tomatoes are lightly charred in spots and have started to burst, 6 to 8 minutes, using a pair of tongs to rotate the tomatoes occasionally so that they cook evenly. Cook the onions until lightly charred and the flesh is tender, 6 to 8 minutes total. Cook the pickle slices until lightly charred and have distinct grill marks, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the grilled vegetables to the same baking sheet that they were on before.                          Cool the vegetables slightly before quartering the tomatoes and chopping the onions and pickle slices into small pieces. Place the cut vegetables into a medium mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the pickle brine. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reserve.                          Remove the shrimp dogs from the refrigerator and brush them liberally with the remaining tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Use your hands to carefully arrange the shrimp dogs on the grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total, using a pair of tongs to rotate the shrimp dogs as they cook. You will know that they are cooked through when the texture turns from soft to springy and a cake tester inserted through the center comes out hot to the touch. Transfer to a plate or baking sheet.                          Gently open up each of the 4 hot dog buns, being careful not to unhinge them. Arrange the hot dog buns cut-side down on the grill and cook until lightly charred and warmed through, about 1 minute. Smear the inside of the grilled buns with the remaining 2 tablespoons mayonnaise.                          Place a shrimp dog on each hot dog bun then spread a spoonful of the reserved relish on top of each. Serve with any remaining relish on the side.
