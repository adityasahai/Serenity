Microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until it is just melted and smooth. You could do this in the top of a double boiler if you don't have a microwave. Let this mixture cool while you mix the rest of the ingredients.Whisk together the rice flour, potato starch, cocoa powder, tapioca starch, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla until lighter in colour, about 2 minutes with the paddle attachment. Stir in the chocolate/butter mixture.Once this has been completely incorporated, stir in the dry ingredients. Beat for 1 minute on medium speed.The dough will have the consistency of thick cake batter. Cover, and refrigerate for AT LEAST one hour, longer if the dough is still too soft. If you refrigerate it overnight, take it out 30 minutes before you want to bake to allow the dough to soften slightly.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C). Line your baking pans with parchment paper.Using a sharp knife, cut the marshmallows in half.Unwrap the Caramilk bars, and break them into squares. Place the squares in a container and put them in the freezer until you need them.Roll the dough into 1-inch (2.5cm) balls, placing them 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the prepared pans. I use a cookie scoop to get my cookies even.Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12 minutes.Place a marshmallow (sticky side down) on top of a Caramilk square. Press one chocolate/marshmallow into the top of each cookie.Bake for an additional 4 minutes.Place cookies on a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Garnish the tops with grated chocolate, if you desire.Store cookies in an air-tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the chocolate chips and butter in a microwave safe bowl.
