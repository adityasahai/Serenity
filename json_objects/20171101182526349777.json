Set beets on a baking dish and bake for 60 minutes at 400 degrees. The beets should be very tender all the way through.If the beets are hard at all, roast for another 15 minutes.2) Let the beets cool for 10 minutes or so when they come out of the oven and then use a peeler or paring knife to peel the beets.3) Slice the beets thinly (about 1/8 inch thick) and lay beets on a bed of arugula or spinach. Top with chopped pistachios, crumbled goat cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper.4) You could also serve on individual plates, but I like to serve it as one large platter.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Let the beets cool for 10 minutes or so when they come out of the oven and then use a peeler or paring knife to peel the beets.3) Slice the beets thinly (about 1/8 inch thick) and lay beets on a bed of arugula or spinach.
