Riesling are great choices for African. The best wine for African dishes will depend on the dish, but a fruity, aromatic white wine is a safe bet for spicy dishes while pinotage would be a traditional match for South African cuisine. The Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438881,"title":"Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier","description":"The 2014 release of this intriguing blend delights the nose with a charming bouquet of enticing aromas of fresh Meyer lemon, fuzzy peach, ripe honeydew melon and yellow plum, mingled with touches of citrus blossom and white tea. The clean, vibrant palate enters with juicy pomelo, sweet lychee and honeyedtangerine fruits, balanced by vibrant acidity and hints of yellow apple and key lime pie that last through the crisp and refreshing finish.With its balanced acidity, this versatile wine pairs well with a number of dishes, from light salads to seafood to, most notably, foods with a hint of spiciness - its subtle sweetness provides balance alongside a touch of heat. Try Chenin Blanc + Viognier with a flavorful Thai curry, a sushi dish, such asa spicy tuna roll, or seared halibut.
