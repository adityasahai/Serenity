Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples.
