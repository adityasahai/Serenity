Fry for a few mins over a medium heat, until the fat has started to come out of the bacon. Add the mushrooms, turn up the heat a little, then fry for another 3-4 mins until the mushrooms are cooked through and golden and the bacon is crisp. Tip onto a heatproof plate and keep warm, either in a low oven or covered with foil. In the same pan, heat the oil, then gently fry the onion for 5 mins or until soft. Add the garlic and fry for another min, then tip in the rice. Pour in the stock, stir once and bring to the boil. Turn down to a gentle simmer and cook for 10 mins, until almost all of the liquid has gone. The rice will be a little underdone at this point. Take off the heat, give it a stir and cover with a lid (or a big plate). Leave for 5 mins to finish cooking in its own steam. Stir most of the cheese through the rice, then season to taste. Serve in bowls topped with the bacon and mushrooms and the rest of the cheese sprinkled over.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a large, non-stick saucepan and tip in the bacon.
