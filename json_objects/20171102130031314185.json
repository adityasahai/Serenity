Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. One wine you could try is Pacific Rim Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":446903,"title":"Pacific Rim Riesling","description":"Portraying bright crispness, subtle sweetness and aromas of jasmine, pear and apple, Pacific Rim Riesling exemplifies the harmony of Riesling.
