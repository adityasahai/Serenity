Pour about 1/4-cup of batter on the heated surface to form a pancake, and let it sit there (untouched) for about 1-2 minutes, or until little bubbles start popping up in the middle and the edges begin to harden. Use a spatula to flip the pancake, then cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the pancake is cooked through and golden on the outside.
