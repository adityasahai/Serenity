A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Turn the heat down and let the water simmer.In the bowl of your stand mixer, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Place the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk frequently until the egg mixture is lukewarm (about 100 degrees fahrenheit).Remove the bowl from the heat, and using the whisk attachment of your stand mixer, beat on medium high until the mixture has cooled and tripled in volume (about 5 minutes). The mixture will have thickened and will form a slowly dissolving ribbon when you lift the whisk.While the eggs are whisking, in a separate bowl, whisk together the cake flour, cornstarch, and cocoa powder.Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the eggs, and use a rubber spatula to fold them together, making sure that you scrape the bottom of the bowl. Be gentle so as not to deflate the eggs. Repeat this process two more times until all of the flour has been incorporated.Divide the batter evenly between the 3 prepared pans. If there is excess flour at the bottom of the bowl, leave it there, since it may prevent the cake from rising properly.Bake for 20-23 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Remove from the oven, immediately run a knife around the edges of the pan, and turn the cakes out onto wire racks.Cool completely.Combine the morello cherry juice and amaretto liquor and set aside.Combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt in a bowl (I used the bowl of my stand mixer).Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. The bowl should not touch the water, nor should the water be at a rolling boil. It's the steam that's going to heat the egg whites.Heat the egg white mixture until it reaches 160 degrees fahrenheit, whisking frequently so as not to get scrambled eggs.Remove the bowl from the heat, and whip the egg whites on medium high using the whisk attachment of your stand mixer.Whip the egg whites until they become fluffy and double in volume. The bowl should be neutral to the touch (this will usually take several minutes).Turn the mixer down to medium low, and add the butter in one chunk at a time, until it has all been incorporated.If the mixture looks curdled at this point, this is normal. Just keep whipping for a few more minutes until it comes together. If the mixture looks soupy, you can add a few cubes of chilled butter, or stick the whole bowl in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes and then continue beating.Once the buttercream has become smooth, and the melted chocolate all at once and beat until incorporated. You'll need to do this quickly, since the melted chocolate can form chips against the side of the bowl.Add the vanilla and almond extract and beat until incorporated.Place one layer of the cake on a plate or cake stand.Brush with Cherry Amaretto syrup.Place 1/3 of the frosting on top of the cake layerPlace 3/4 morello cherries on top of the frosting.Repeat with the 2nd and 3rd layers and top with chocolate shavings.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit and grease and line 3 6-inch cake pans with parchment.Fill a medium saucepan a little less than half full and bring the water to a boil.
