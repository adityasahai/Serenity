Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"<ol><li><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Cook tortellini according to package directions; drain and cool. </span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Steam broccoli until tender, about 6 minutes; cool. </span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Cook corn in boiling water, 5 minutes; cool, then slice kernels off cob. </span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">T</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">oss tortellini, broccoli, and corn with dressing, lemon juice, carrots, tomatoes; salt to taste.</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span></li></ol>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook tortellini according to package directions; drain and cool.
