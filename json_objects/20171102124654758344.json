Stir in the yeast. Mix in the flour, about  cup at a time, until it forms a dough and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl (generally around 2 cups total). Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead for a few minutes, or until the dough mostly springs back when you gently press your index finger into it. Let the dough rest while preparing the filling.To prepare the filling, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl.Lightly coat a 9-round pan with nonstick cooking spray.On a clean, well-floured surface, roll out the dough into a 14x10 rectangle. Brush with the melted butter and sprinkle with the spiced sugar, leaving a  border on the two longer edges. Gently pat the spiced sugar into the dough with your palms. Carefully roll up into a log from one long edge to the other. Slice into 12 rolls using unscented dental floss (as shown in the video below). Arrange the rolls into the prepared pan. Cover the pan with a clean towel, and place in a warm draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until doubled in size.Preheat the oven to 350F. Once the rolls have risen, bake them at 350F for 18-21 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the sides feel firm. Cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare the dough, whisk together the eggnog, butter, brown sugar, nutmeg, and salt until thoroughly combined.
