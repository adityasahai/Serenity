Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preparation:Make the sauce first. In a glass measuring cup, combine the soy sauce, water, rice vinegar and sugar. Heat for 1/2 to 1 minute on high and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the peanut butter and sesame oil and whisk with a fork until smooth. Add a few dashes of hot sauce to taste and if necessary, add a bit more water until the sauce is the consistency of syrup.
