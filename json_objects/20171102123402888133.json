Zinfandel. Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. The Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437917,"title":"Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon 2009 is deep crimson red in color. The nose is complex with ripe blackcurrant cassis and red cherry fruit anchored by attractive base notes of oak, earthiness and a wisp of woodsmoke. The wine attacks with bright fleshy cherry fruit built upon by layers of leaf and leather. The finish is mouthfilling and lingering and the tannins giving persistent flesh and presence.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437917-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ringbolt-cabernet-sauvignon-2009/112598"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375F degrees.In a medium bowl, mix the ground turkey, onion, egg and bread crumbs just until mixed.
