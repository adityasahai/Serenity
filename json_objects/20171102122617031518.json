Slice Napa cabbage into 1/4 inch slices, you may want to roughly chop the cabbage again so the pieces aren't too large. Slice green onion tops and add to bowl, reserve the white parts of the onions for another recipe.Melt butter in a large sauce pan, add Ramen noodles to saucepan breaking them as you put them into the sauce pan. The most difficult part of this recipe is browning the noodles, and not burning them. It doesn't take long before the noodles are burnt, it seems to happen only a second or two after they are toasted, watch them carefully. Add toasted Ramen noodles to salad. Add slivered almonds to salad, use your hands and toss the cabbage, green onions, toasted ramen noodles, and almond slivers well.To make the dressing, use a medium sized bowl, or a shake bottle if you have it, add sugar, vinegar, dry ginger, dry mustard powder, Worechester sauce, and vegetable oil. Whisk thoroughly, it may seem the sugar won't dissolve, it will. If you wanted, I bet you could substitute the sugar with either equal or splenda. Once the sugar as completely dissovled pour over slaw, and mix well.I have taken Asian Crunchy Slaw to a couple of pot lucks recently with hopes that I would have a little extra to take home, and this didn't happen. So I think this recipe is a real winner.
