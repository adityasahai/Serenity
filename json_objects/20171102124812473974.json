A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Let stand for about 5 minutes.Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla extract, and whisk together until the mixture becomes frothy.Sift together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk together until the flour mixture disappears.Divide the batter evenly between the 3 pans (I used a kitchen scale to do this) and bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Cool the pans on wire racks for about 15 minutes. Then turn the cakes out of the pans onto the wire racks and cool completely before frosting.With an electric mixer, beat the butter and shortening together on medium high speed (or medium if using a stand mixer) for about 2-3 minutes, until light and creamy.Add the powdered sugar and beat on low to combine.Turn the mixer up to medium high and beat for an additional 2 minutes.Add the vanilla extract and salt and beat to combine.Add the non-dairy milk in one tablespoon at a time until the frosting reaches a spreadable consistency.Place one layer of the cake on a 6-inch cake board.Place about 1/2 cup of frosting on top, and use an offset spatula to spread evenly over the first layer.Place the second layer on top of the first and do the same with the frosting.Place the third layer on top, and put a large dollop of frosting on the top of the cake.Using an offset spatula, work your way around the sides until the entire cake is covered with a thin layer of frosting. I find that a turntable is helpful during this process. Let the crumb coat set in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Once the crumb coat has set, spread a thicker layer of frosting on the top and sides of the crumb coat to create a smooth finish. Use the leftover frosting to pipe onto the cake and top with sprinkles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.Grease and line 3 6-inch cake pans with parchment paper.In a large bowl, whisk together the non-dairy milk and vinegar.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let stand for about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla extract, and whisk together until the mixture becomes frothy.Sift together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk together until the flour mixture disappears.Divide the batter evenly between the 3 pans (I used a kitchen scale to do this) and bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Cool the pans on wire racks for about 15 minutes.
