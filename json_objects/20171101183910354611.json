Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"1. In a large bowl, mix together the butter, Tabasco, sugar, chili sauce, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, paprika, and cayenne. 2. In another large bowl, combine the flour and remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons salt. Dredge the chicken wings in the flour mixture to coat, and then place them on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 90 minutes.3. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or in a deep stockpot until it registers 350°F (176°C) on a deep-fry or candy thermometer.4. Fry the floured chicken wings in small batches until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. (Be careful not to crowd the chicken wings or they’ll steam and turn soggy rather than fry and turn crisp!) Transfer the chicken wings to a plate lined with paper towels or to a brown paper bag as they come out of the oil. Let cool ever so slightly.5. Toss the chicken wings with the sauce, pile them on a platter, and serve with plenty of napkins!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, mix together the butter, Tabasco, sugar, chili sauce, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, paprika, and cayenne. 2.
