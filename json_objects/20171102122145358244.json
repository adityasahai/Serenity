Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color.

The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"1 Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. If using Chinese noodles, do not add salt (they are already salted). If using soba or pasta noodles, add a tablespoon of salt to the water. Add the noodles to the pot. Stir the noodles frequently while they cook. Check the noodle package instructions, if using Chinese noodles, they should be done after 5 minutes of cooking. Drain the noodles, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Spread the noodles out on a sheet pan to air dry.2 Place a steamer rack in the bottom of a 3 to 4-quart pot. Add enough water to come up to the level of the steamer. Heat until boiling. Add the broccoli florets. Cover and steam cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the pot and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Set aside.3 Place the cooked noodles in a large serving bowl. Toss with soy sauce to coat completely. Let sit to absorb the soy sauce while you make the dressing. 4 Place the ginger, sugar, garlic, and red pepper flakes into a mini chopper or food processor. Pulse until finely ground. Add the vinegar and both oils to the ginger mixture. Pulse again until well blended.5 Add the dressing to the soy-sauce infused noodles, tossing to coat completely. Then add the cooked broccoli, the sliced green onions, sliced bell pepper, sliced cabbage, shredded carrot, and mung bean sprouts.If making more than a day ahead, toss the noodles with the soy sauce and half of the dressing and prep the vegetables. Then when ready to serve, toss the noodles with the vegetables and the rest of the dressing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot.
