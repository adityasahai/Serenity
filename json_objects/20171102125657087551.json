Butter three 8-inch (or 9-inch) round cake pans, line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper, then butter the parchment. Lightly dust the cake pans with flour, shaking out excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.Using a small food processor (or in a bowl, using your fingers), process one cup sugar with the orange zest. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together on medium-high speed the orange sugar, the remaining cup of granulated sugar, and the butter. Beat until light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and Grand Marnier, and continue beating the mixture for another 5 minutes.Reduce mixer speed to low, then add flour mixture alternating with yogurt, in three batches, beginning and ending with flour. Mix just until smooth. Divide the batter equally among the three cake pans, rap the pans once or twice on the counter to get rid of any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each layer comes out clean, about 20-25 minutes for 9-inch cake pans or 25-30 minutes for 8-inch pans, rotating cake layers about halfway through baking time. Cool layers in pans for about 10 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edge of each and invert layers onto cooling racks to cool completely. (Note: Layers can be made in advance. Bake up to 1 week ahead, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, store individual layers in a plastic freezer bag, and freeze. Thaw layers overnight in refrigerator the night before you plan to assemble the cake.)Prepare FrostingIn the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low and slowly add confectioners' sugar. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine orange zest, orange juice, vanilla, and salt; stir until salt is dissolved, then add to the butter mixture. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. If you desire, add a drop or two of food coloring to tint the frosting.(Note: Frosting can be made ahead, up to 2 days, and refrigerated in a tightly covered container. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes when ready to use. Beat on medium-low in stand mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.)Assemble CakeTo frost cakes, place 1 layer on a cake plate. With an offset spatula, spread top with about 1 cup of frosting. Place the second cake layer on top, and repeat. Place third layer on top and spread frosting in a thin layer over the sides and top of the cake. Chill briefly in refrigerator, until frosting is firm, then spread sides and top with the remaining frosting. You will end up with a bit of leftover frosting which can be used for additional decorating if you like.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make Cake Layers","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees with racks in the upper and middle positions.
