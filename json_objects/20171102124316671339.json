Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat and add the garlic.                          Throw in the mushrooms, wine, salt and pepper, and cook them, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces by half, 3 to 4 minutes.                          Sprinkle the flour all over, then stir to combine.                          Pour in the broth, stir and continue to cook until the sauce is nice and thick, 3 to 4 minutes.                          Add the cream cheese and stir until it mixes in. (Don't worry if it seems a little lumpy at first. That will go away!)
