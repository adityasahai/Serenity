In my recipe, I used about 1/2 a packet of the lasagna noodlesTake 3 medium sized squashes and 3 medium sized zucchinis.  Using a mandoline, slice thin chips of the zucchini and squash.In a bowl, add the sliced zucchini and squash.  Add 2 tsp of dried oregano, basil, parsley and rosemary.  If you have any of these fresh herbs, use that instead.Add 1 tsp of salt and 2 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and mix well.Spread the vegetable mixture on a baking tray and place in the oven.  Let them roast for about 20 minutes or until the edges start to brown. Remove and allow them to coolWhile the veggies are roasting, add 4 cups of silken tofu to a food processor.Add 3 tsp of salt or to taste and 2 tsp of whole peppercorns to the silken tofuDrain 3 cups of thawed spinach and add it to the tofu.  Add 1 tsp of lemon zest to it and blend on low speed until everything is blended.  Place the tofu mixture in a separate bowl and refrigerate for 30 minTake 1 cup of mushrooms and slice them thinly.

I spread about 2 tsps on the bottomLay down 3 cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.  Use as many noodles as you need to fill the bottom of the casserole dishStart by spreading the tofu mixture on top of the lasagna noodles.  Be generous.Top with the zucchini and squash mixture.Top with Bertolli 5 Cheese Sauce.Repeat from #13 and continue until you are on the last layer.  On this layer, instead of adding the zucchini mixture, layer with the mushroom and onion mixture.Close with one last layer of noodles and spread any remaining tofu mixture on top.  If you have any veggies left, layer them tooAdd one last layer of Bertolli sauce and place in the oven.
