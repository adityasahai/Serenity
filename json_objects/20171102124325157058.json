Cover and refrigerate overnight in the fridge (or for a few hours if you are short on time).For the topping, mix flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold butter in with a food processor or just using your fingers until your mixture looks like small crumbs.When you're ready to eat, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle crumb mixture over the top of the croissant/egg mixture in the pan. Bake for 30-45 minutes depending on how soft/crispy you want it to be. Make sure the french toast is fully cooked before you remove it from the oven - usually the top looks done before the inside is really done.Top with butter and drizzle with maple syrup.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grease a small baking pan with butter (I just used a small loaf pan).
