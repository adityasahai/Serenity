Add in the cold butter and pulse until the butter is broken down to the size of small peas. Slowly add in the water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Gather the dough into a ball and flatten into a disc. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.Heat oven to 400F.Meanwhile, make the filling. In a large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the curry powder, mustard seeds, and cardamom to the pan. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, or until mustard seeds begin to pop. Stir in the onion and jalapeno. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until translucent, stirring frequently. Mix in the potato, carrot, and parsnip, stirring to coat in the spices. Pour in the broth. Lower the heat to medium and then cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the squash and sugar. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, or until squash is tender and most of the liquid has evaporated. If the mixture is totally dry, add in a few tablespoons of water. Remove from the heat.Spray a mini pie pan or large muffin tin with cooking spray. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry dough until it is 1/16-inch thick. Cut out 4-6 circles, depending on the size of your tins, 5-6 inches in diameter. Press the circles down into the tins. Reroll out the dough and cut out the same number of circles, this time an inch or so smaller, to form the tops.Stir 1 cup of the cheese into the filling. Divide the filling among the pie crusts (you might have extra filling!). Place the second rounds of pie dough on top and press to seal. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining cheese. Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until golden brown. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the flour and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add in the cold butter and pulse until the butter is broken down to the size of small peas.
