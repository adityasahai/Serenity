picks for Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 °C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Put the flour, salt, olive oil, yeast, rosemary and pepper into a food processor. Pulse until well mixed. With the motor running, add enough water to bring the flour to a soft, but not sticky dough. Tip onto a work surface and knead until it comes together.Halve the dough. If you only have one shelf in your oven and are cooking in batches, wrap one half in cling film. Roll out each half directly onto lightly oiled baking sheets into very thin 25cm/10in rounds. Do not form a rim at the edge. Spread the tomato topping over each piece of dough, almost to the edge. Leave to stand for 15 mins. Bake in the hot oven for 12-15 mins or until the dough is crisp.Lift each round onto a plate and serve warm.
