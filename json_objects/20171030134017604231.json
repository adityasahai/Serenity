After the last fold, flatten it a bit, then put it into a plastic bag and put it into the refrigerator for at least an hour, or up to three days.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When you are ready to make the croissants, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. The dough will have risen while refrigerated. Cut the dough into quarters.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Roll the first quarter into about a 6-inch square. Cut the square into quarters diagonally.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Take one of your right triangles of dough and roll or stretch it into a pie-shaped wedge at least seven inches long. You can make it longer if the dough is thick enough to allow it, but at least seven inches will give you enough length to have attractive wraps.                                                                                                                            9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Starting at the wide end, roll the dough toward the the point.                                                                                                                            10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place the finished croissants on the prepared baking sheet with the point underneath. Curl the dough into a crescent shape.                                                                                                                            11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cover them with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes. They won't rise much at all, but they should feel puffy instead of firm. Brush the croissants with an egg wash, if desired, or leave them plain. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, until they are golden brown. Remove to a rack to cool.                                                                                                                            12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Variation: For chocolate croissants, follow the original recipe though Step 6, then roll the quarter of dough into a rectangle about 10 x 6 inches. Cut that into strips about 2 1/2 inches wide x 6 inches long.                                                                                                                            13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Put your favorite chocolate at one end, and roll up. It works best to make sure the dough is just a little wider than the chocolate and fold it over to enclose the chocolate when you start rolling, so it doesn't seep out during baking. Place the rolls seam-side down on the pan and allow them to rise and bake as in the original recipe.", u'spoonacularSourceUrl': u'https://spoonacular.com/bread-baking-easyer-croissants-199260', u'dishTypes': [], u'occasions': [], u'vegetarian': True, u'ketogenic': False, u'readyInMinutes': 45, u'servings': 16, u'sustainable': False, u'dairyFree': False, u'whole30': False}]}
