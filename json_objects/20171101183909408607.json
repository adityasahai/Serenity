Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat a large skillet to medium high and add the butter (or ghee).Brown until the bubbles or foam subsides, approx. 3 min.Reduce the temperature to medium-low and add the thinly sliced garlic and stir continuously. *It's very easy for garlic to burn, so keep them moving!Crisp the garlic slices for 3 to 4 minutes.Add the chile flakes and Italian seasoning, stir and allow the herbs to bloom for 30 seconds.Add the harvested roasted spaghetti squash to the skillet and toss in the crispy garlic browned butter sauce.Sprinkle with lemon zest, salt and pepper.Toss again to mix the additional seasonings and serve hot.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a large skillet to medium high and add the butter (or ghee).Brown until the bubbles or foam subsides, approx. 3 min.Reduce the temperature to medium-low and add the thinly sliced garlic and stir continuously. *It's very easy for garlic to burn, so keep them moving!Crisp the garlic slices for 3 to 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chile flakes and Italian seasoning, stir and allow the herbs to bloom for 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":1022027,"name":"italian seasoning","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/Herbes-de-Provence.jpg"},{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the harvested roasted spaghetti squash to the skillet and toss in the crispy garlic browned butter sauce.Sprinkle with lemon zest, salt and pepper.Toss again to mix the additional seasonings and serve hot.","ingredients":[{"id":11492,"name":"spaghetti squash","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti-squash.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spices.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]}]}]}]}
