Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

If you have time, let it marinate for an hour or up to a few hours.Cook the pasta in plenty of water to al dente. Before draining scoop out 1/3 cup of the starchy pasta water and set aside.While the pasta cooks heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the carrots, pepper and snow peas with a dash or two of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often to your desired doneness, I cook them until fork tender because that's how my family likes them. Add the corn at the end and cook until heated through. Turn off the heat.Add the drained pasta, the pasta water you set aside earlier and all the dressing. Toss well and allow to sit while you cook the chicken. The noodles are best eaten at room temperature and will soak up the dressing as it cools. You can come back to it and toss it again.Cook the chicken on an outdoor grill, on a George Forman grill or in a grill pan until cooked through. Internal temperature on a meat thermometer should reach 165 - 174 degrees F. Let the chicken sit 5 minutes then slice at an angle.To serve, top the noodles with the chicken and sprinkle with nuts and scallions. Pass around lime wedges and hot sauce to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add all the dressing ingredients to a bowl of a food processor and pulse until smooth and combined.
