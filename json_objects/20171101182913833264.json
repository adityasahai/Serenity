The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese.

Place pizza stone in oven and rest 30 minutes. Meanwhile combine 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and garlic in a small bowl. Spread and shape pizza crust into a 12 - 13 inch round over a sheet of lightly floured parchment paper, while creating a rim along edge of dough. Brush pizza dough evenly with olive oil mixture. Sprinkle evenly with oregano, basil, thyme (leaving rim uncovered with herbs) and season lightly with salt and pepper. Top evenly with mozzarella and feta cheese. Bake in preheated oven 12 - 15 minutes until crust is golden. Meanwhile, saute peppers in a skillet in 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium high heat until tender (you could also just add them on without sauteing). Remove pizza from oven and immediately top with peppers, tomatoes, olives, onion and parsley.
