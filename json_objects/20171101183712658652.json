A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

If using a seeded watermelon, remove seeds.Soften gelatin in 1 teaspoon cold water. Set a kettle of water to boil and then add 3 tablespoons of boiling water to softened gelatin. Stir until dissolved. Let cool but do not let harden. It is best to dissolve the gelatin after peeling and chopping watermelon to prevent hardening.Chop and puree watermelon. Puree should be about 3 cups. If there are still seeds in your watermelon, run the watermelon pulp through the large disk of a food mill. Whisk gelatin, lemon, agave, and salt into watermelon pulp. Put in a covered container and freeze, stirring every hour with a fork. This will create large ice crystals. Depending on the temperature of your freezer, this should take between 4 and 5 hours.Take granita out of freezer 10 minutes and let it set on the counter to soften slightly. Place in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and process until smooth. Serve immediately, or put in the freezer for up to 20 minutes before serving. Any longer will make the granita too hard.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove rind from watermelon.
