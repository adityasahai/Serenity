Line muffin tin with paper liners and set aside.Mix egg, milk, and oil in small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Add frozen chopped strawberries and gently fold, just enough to coat the berries with the flour mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently fold again, taking care to not overmix. Spoon batter into muffin tin. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until muffin tops are puffed and golden. Let cool on a wire rack.Stir all ingredients until combined and smooth.
