Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Whisk together the cornstarch, orange juice and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Add the mixture to the insert, add the peaches and granulated sugar and toss.                          For the biscuit topping: Whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub the mixture together with your fingertips so that it forms a coarse meal with some pea-sized lumps. Add the milk and almond extract if using and stir with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough.                          Drop spoonfuls of the dough on top of the peach mixture. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar with the cinnamon and ginger and sprinkle over the dough. Cover the slow cooker and set to high for 3 to 4 hours. The cobbler should be bubbly and the biscuits should be cooked through. Let rest for 20 minutes before serving.                          For the sour cream topping: Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream, sour cream and confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl and beat with an electric mixture until the mixture forms medium peaks.                          Spoon the cobbler into bowls and top with the whipped sour cream topping.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the filling: Butter the sides and bottom of the insert of a 6-quart slow cooker.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk together the cornstarch, orange juice and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":9206,"name":"orange juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg"},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the mixture to the insert, add the peaches and granulated sugar and toss.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"For the biscuit topping","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butter and rub the mixture together with your fingertips so that it forms a coarse meal with some pea-sized lumps.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the milk and almond extract if using and stir with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough.","ingredients":[{"id":1002050,"name":"almond extract","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404732,"name":"wooden spoon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/wooden-spoon.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Drop spoonfuls of the dough on top of the peach mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar with the cinnamon and ginger and sprinkle over the dough.
