Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 42 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage. Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose. The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.","price":"$41.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438237-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gary-farrell-russian-river-pinot-noir-2007/102829"}]},"instructions":"To roast the cauliflower: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss cauliflower florets with enough olive oil to cover them in a light, even layer of oil. Season with salt and pepper and arrange the florets in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway, until the florets are deeply golden on the edges.Warm the olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Saut the onion and garlic with a dash of salt for about 5 minutes, until the onions are softened and turning translucent. Add the tomato paste, cumin and chili powder and saut for another minute, stirring constantly. Add the lentils and the vegetable broth or water. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes to 35 minutes, until the lentils are tender and cooked through. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Once the lentils are done cooking, drain off any excess liquid, then cover and set aside.To prepare the chipotle sauce, just whisk together the ingredients and set aside (if you have no choice but to use whole chipotle peppers from the can, use a blender to pure it all).Warm tortillas individually in a pan over medium heat. Stack the warm tortillas and cover them with a tea towel if you wont be serving the tacos immediately.Once all of your components are ready, you can assemble your tacos! Top each tortilla with the lentil mixture, cauliflower, a drizzle of chipotle sauce and a generous sprinkle of chopped cilantro.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To roast the cauliflower: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
