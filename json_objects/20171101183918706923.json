Heat until just before boiling, remove, and let cool about half an hour. When warm, sprinkle in yeast. Let sit for a minute, then add 4 cups of flour. Stir together and let rise for an hour, cover with a towel.After one hour, add remaining ½ cup flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir together. Let sit another half hour, covered.(At this point you can either continue on with the recipe, or put your dough in the refrigerator overnight.)Punch dough down, and sprinkle counter with flour. Roll dough and form a rectangle. Roll dough thin. Drizzle melted butter over dough, sugars and generous amounts of cinnamon. Roll dough into a long log, keeping it tight. Pinch seam.In pie pans, spread a tablespoon or so of melted butter (very important!!!). Begin cutting the rolls about 1 inch thick and lay them in pans. Let rise for another 30-60 minutes.Bake at 400 degrees for about 15-18 minutes. While baking, prepare frosting. Mix powdered sugar, maple flavoring (optional), milk, coffee (optional) and salt. It should be thick, but pourable. Drizzle over warm rolls, GENEROUSLY! Enjoy!This recipe can easily be doubled, just divide dough in half before rolling it out. Before frosting the rolls, I put in a ziploc in the freezer for future use. A great recipe when you have a lot of mouths to feed!(recipe from Pioneer Woman)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix oil, milk and ½ cup sugar in a pan.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat until just before boiling, remove, and let cool about half an hour.
