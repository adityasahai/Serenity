In a small saucepan, heat the water, milk and butter to 120°-130°. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add 1 egg; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.                                                                                            Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Shape dough into one 2-in. ball, four 1-1/2-in. balls, one 1-in. ball and one large round ball.                                                                                            For turtle shell, place the large dough ball in the center of a greased baking sheet. Place the 2-in. ball at the top for head; position 1-1/2-in. balls on either side for feet. Shape the 1-in. ball into a triangle for tail; place on opposite side of large ball from head.                                                                                            Press all edges together to seal. Add raisins for eyes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes.                                                                                            Beat the remaining egg; brush over dough. With a sharp knife, make shallow diamond-shaped slashes across top of turtle shell.                                                                                            Bake at 350° for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
