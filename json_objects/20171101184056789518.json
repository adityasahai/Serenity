Then strain both jars of the fermenting kefir into the third clean jar with the fresh fruit in it, straining out the kefir grains ( set them aside) filling the jar to a  inch from the top. Then cover tightly with a lid, and leave on the counter another 24 hours. Your kefir will start bubbling.I will tell you that these metal lids like in this photo, are not ideal. The plastic lids are best.The water kefir is creating gas and building pressure, which you want it to do - this makes it nice and bubbly, but with the metal lids, you must let out some of the pressure, \"burping it\" every 6 hours or so, so the lid doesn't bend open ( yes this happened to me). With a plastic lid, it stays on fine.After 24 hours, the fruit will float the the surface and it's time to refrigerate it. Once it's chilled, give it a try. You can eat the fruit, it won't hurt you, but I generally just strain it as I pour.The kefir grains that you strained out earlier can be stored in a smaller jar, in the fridge in sugar water or the extra kefir water you will have after you merge the two jars into one. When refrigerated, you want to feed the grains at least once a week, to keep them healthy and alive. They are happiest when they are actually making water kefir, so I just make a jar a week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill two, half gallon mason jars with 4 cups cool water in each.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405938,"name":"canning jar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mason-jar.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add  cup sugar in each, stirring to mostly dissolve.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add  cup kefir grains to each jar.","ingredients":[{"id":93611,"name":"kefir","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add  kefir water to each jar ( optional--you can do this after your first batch of kefir)","ingredients":[{"id":93611,"name":"kefir","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add  of a lemon wedge to each jar.","ingredients":[{"id":9150,"name":"lemon wedge","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-wedge.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Add 1 prune to each jar.Cover both jars with a thin kitchen cloth and leave on the counter for 2-3 days. 2 days if warm out, 3 days if cold.After 2-3 days the kefir will have fermented slightly, but there is one more step which gives it flavor and makes it effervescent and bubbly.Get your third jar and place 1- 1 cups fresh fruit in it-- like fresh berries, peaches, apricots, pineapple, plums, concord grapes, apples, pears.
