A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Add both sugars and beat until very well blended, about 5 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla, and beat until fully incorporated. Fold flour mixture into sugar mixture with a spatula. Then fold in chocolate. Divide batter evenly among four ramekins (my ramekins hold approximately 7 ounces each) and then placeramekins in a 9\" x 9\"pan. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours or up to 2 days.Preheat oven to 350.Let ramekins stand at room temperature 10 minutes. Uncover pan and bake for 24 to 26 minutes, or until center of cakes puffand are slightly crusty on top. If you want an extra gooey center, start checking the cakes after 20 minutes of baking time, removing the cakes from the oven before they are fully puffed in the center - take care to not over bake. A longer baking time will ensure a more baked center crumb. Remove from oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Then divide marshmallow creme amongst the cake cups, spreading evenly. This much marshmallow creme will give you a very, very sweet tasting cake cup - if you desire less sweetness, reduce the amount of marshmallow creme. Finish by sprinkling the pink tinted coconut onto the marshmallow layer, dividing the coconut evenly amongst the four cake cups.Serve immediately for the most gooey, fudgy texture.Note: If the warm sno ball chocolate cake cups are allowed to sit for awhile, the marshmallow creme will start to softenand mingle with the gooey chocolate cake. If you wish to make these cake cups ahead of time, to serve later in the day or the following day, I would recommend not adding the marshmallow creme and coconut layers until the chocolate cake has completely cooled.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt.In a medium bowl, beat butter with a mixer at medium speed for 1 minute.","ingredients":[{"id":10014214,"name":"instant espresso","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-coffee-or-instant-espresso.png"},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19165,"name":"cocoa powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add both sugars and beat until very well blended, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add eggs and vanilla, and beat until fully incorporated.
