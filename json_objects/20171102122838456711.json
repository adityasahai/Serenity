Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. A light and crisp sparkling rosé complements fluffy angel food cake - even more so if you're serving it with strawberries. Of course a sweet sparkling white wine will work too. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Sift 1 cup brown sugar and flour together twice; set aside.                                                                                           Place oven rack in lowest position. Preheat oven to 350°. Add cream of tartar, vanilla and salt to egg whites; beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining brown sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Gradually fold in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time.                                                                                           Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned and entire top appears dry. Immediately invert pan; cool completely, about 1 hour.                                                                                           Run a knife around side and center tube of pan. Remove cake to a serving plate.                                                                                           For toffee, line a 13x9-in. baking pan with foil; grease the foil with 1 teaspoon butter. Sprinkle pecans into prepared pan; set aside.                                                                                           In a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, bring brown sugar and remaining butter to a boil, stirring constantly. Cover and cook 2 minutes. Cook and stir with a clean spoon until a candy thermometer reads 300° (hard-crack stage). Immediately pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle with chips; spread with a knife when melted. Refrigerate for about 1 hour or until set.                                                                                           Frost cake with whipped topping. Finely chop half of the toffee; press onto cake. Serve with remaining toffee if desired. Store leftover toffee in an airtight container.                                        Yield: 16 servings.                                                                                                     Editor's Note: We recommend that you test your candy thermometer before each use by bringing water to a boil; the thermometer should read 212°.  Adjust your recipe temperature up or down based on your test.
