If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors.

I mean, queso = cheese, so how exactly does onemake a cheese dip without cheese?! Allow me to enlighten youThe secret to this dip is cashews + nutritional yeast.When raw cashews are soaked and then blended they create a creamy base with little to no flavor, so that creates the base of the dip (this seems to be a little trick that vegans have known for years!).The nutritional yeast is a vegan seasoning that has a cheesy flavor, so by adding a few tablespoons to the blended cashews I was able to create a creamy vegan dip with a cheesy flavor.If youve never heard of nutritional yeast before, dont feel bad! I just learned about it myself and will be sharing a 101 video about it next week, so if its new to you, stay tuned and youll be a pro before you know it.Vegan Queso DipVEGAN QUESO DIP:1 cup of raw cashews (soaked for 2-4 hours and drained) cup water1 tsp. kosher salt1 tbsp. + 2tsp lemon juice3 tbsp. nutritional yeast12 ounces of your favorite salsa (1.5 cups)Optional: fresh chopped onion and cilantroIn a food processor or high-speed blender blend cashews, water, salt, lemon juice, and nutritional yeast.
