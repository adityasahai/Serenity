Cover with hot tap water and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Drain the almonds, rinse and add to high speed blender with 3-1/2 cups cold tap water. I used my Vitamix. Turn blender on low speed (I used setting 2 on my Vitamix) and blend for 3 minutes. Then blend 1 minute on high speed. My mixture was completely smooth but if your blender could not get it as smooth simply strain the mixture into a bowl and press down on the nut pulp to extract all the juice. You have now made almond milk. Hooray! If you want to make flavored almond milk simply rinse out your blender and follow the directions for your desired flavoring. Add to the mixer and blend on medium for about 30 seconds. Drink right away or chill in the refrigerator before use. Some separation is normal so make sure to shake before you drink. Will stay fresh for about 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl add 1 cup slivered almonds.
