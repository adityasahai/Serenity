A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Grease and flour a spring form pan. In a bowl mix eggs, oil, yogurt and sugar. Add the vanilla, flour and baking powder and combine. Pour onto the baking pan. In another bowl whisk cream cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and egg. Spoon this cheese mixture over the cake batter and spread, leaving one inch margin of cake batter exposed around the perimeter of the cake. Now you can sprinkle the berries over the cheese mixture. Bake for about 55-65 minutes. Cool in pan.TIP: I store cake in the fridge because of the cheese. I just cut what ever piece we are eating and let it sit at room temperature for about 10-20 minutes before eating it.Adapted from Modern comfort food","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 350 F.
