In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, and salt.  Add shortening and butter and mix in using fingers or a pastry cutter until mixture looks like coarse meal.  Add water one tablespoon at a time until the mixture stays together when firmly pressed.  This may also be done in a food processor.Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.After dough has chilled, roll a little more than half of it so that it is about  inch thick and will fit into your pie plate.  Place in your pie plate and back in the refrigerator to chill while you make the filling and topping.  Refrigerate or freeze the remaining dough to make another pie or some homemade toaster pastries  yum!Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Make the filling.  In a large bowl, combine blueberries, strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and cornstarch.  Stir until combined.  Make the topping.  In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cinnamon, coconut, and oats.  Add the melted butter and oil and stir until well combined and clumpy.Remove the pie pan with crust from the refrigerator.  Mound the filling in the crust, leaving behind most of the liquid, otherwise the pie will be soupy.  Top with the crumb topping.  Place pie on a foil lined baking sheet because it will bubble over.Bake for 15 minutes.  Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F.  Bake for an additional 45 minutes to 1 hour until the crust and topping are golden brown and the filling is bubbling.  Allow pie to cool at least 1 hour before serving.  Pie may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen in quarters, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months.  Thaw in a 350 degree F oven for about 30 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the crust.
