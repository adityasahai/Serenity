White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is District 7 Estate Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"In a deep 12\" skillet or wide dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat.
