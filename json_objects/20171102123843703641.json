Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, sour cream, buttermilk and vanilla extract until smooth.4. Stir in cake mix.5. Take your Oreos and place one at the bottom of each cupcake liner.

Oreo Frosting: Take your Oreo cookies (just the chocolate pieces and not the filling) and crush in a plastic bag using a rolling pin.  If you have a food processor that works the best! Sift your finely crushed Oreos to remove any lumps, because if you use a piping bag any big cookie pieces will clog it.  In a stand mixer, beat butter and cream cheese. Add vanilla extract and slowly add powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.  Fold in crushed Oreos.  Don't stir too much or the frosting will turn a gross (yet delicious) grey color.  9.
