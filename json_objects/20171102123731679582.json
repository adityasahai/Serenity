Add onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add chopped garlic and saute until onions are soft but not caramelized, approximately 3 more minutes.    Add vinegar, sugar, mustard, chili powder, celery seed, salt and pepper to pan and mix well. Add cabbage, toss well and cook for 5-7 minutes til desired tenderness. I  like mine with just a bit of crunch, but you can cook it until it suits your taste.    Taste and adjust salt and pepper if necessary.    Serve warm or room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Slice cabbage into 1/4-1/2\" strips. We used 6mm blade on the Cuisinart.
