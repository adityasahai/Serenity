Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

(Please note that this is a different type of light and fluffy than when using white sugar – it’s a little darker in color and looks a little heavier.) Add salt, vanilla extract, and flour blend, and mix on the lowest setting just until blended.  Add the processed nuts and mix again just until incorporated.  Cover the dough and refrigerate it for 20 – 3o minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Process the remaining 1/2 cup of toasted pecans using the pulse button until finely chopped.  Put the chopped pecans on a plate.  Line two baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.  Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough evently, spacing about 1 inch apart.  Once the first sheet is full of cookies, roll each dough ball in the nut mixture to coat, roll into a ball and place back onto the tray.  Use a flat bottomed glass to press the cookies 1/4 inch thick.  Put the first tray in the oven. Repeat process with remaining dough. Bake one tray at a time for 15 – 18 minutes until the edges start to turn lightly golden brown.  Cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack lined with a paper towel to cool completely. Once cool, bring one inch of water to boil in a 4 quart saucepan.  Put the shortening in the bottom of a glass or stainless steel bowl that will fit snugly on top of the pan.  Add 1 1/2 cups carob on top of the shortening.  Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat off and put the bowl on top of the saucepan. Let it sit for several minutes, stirring occasionally to help the carob melt. Once melted, remove the bowl from the saucepan and dip the cookies halfway into the carob. Shake gently to remove any excess carob.  Set coated cookies on waxed paper, sprinkle lightly with sea salt, and allow it sit until carob is fully set.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Process 1/2 cup of toasted nuts in a food processor using the pulse button until finely chopped and set aside.Cream the butter and the agave in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy.
