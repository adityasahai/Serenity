A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Sprinkle the 1 1/2 t. gelatin over the water and allow to bloom for 5 minutes.Place the coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla bean in a small saucepan and bring just to a simmer. Remove from the heat and add the bloomed gelatin to the pan. Whisk the coconut milk/gelatin mixture until the gelatin has completely dissolved. Discard the vanilla bean, scraping out any remaining vanilla beans and adding them back into the coconut mixture.Divide the panna cotta mixture evenly between 4 1/2 c. dishes or ramekins. Refrigerate the panna cotta for at least 3 hours, or until firmly set.To make the grapefruit gelee:Place 2 T. of the grapefruit juice in a small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over the juice and allow it to bloom for 5 minutes.Place the remaining grapefruit juice and 1 T. sugar in a small saucepan. Bring the juice to a boil and add the bloomed gelatin. Whisk the gelatin into the grapefruit juice until it has fully dissolved. Remove from heat.Remove the chilled panna cottas from the fridge and place 2-3 segmented grapefruit slices on top of each one.
