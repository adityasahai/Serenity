The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. One wine you could try is Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. If using frozen broccoli, thaw it according to the directions on the package.                          Finely grate the parmesan, then place 1/3 cup into the bowl of a food processor along with the broccoli, 2/3 cup basil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. While the processor is running, drizzle in 3 tablespoons olive oil. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.                          Sprinkle a work surface with the cornmeal and use a rolling pin and/or your hands to stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle. Spray the baking sheet with cooking spray and place the dough onto it. Spread the broccoli pesto over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Scatter the goat cheese over the top of the pesto, then thinly slice the tomato and arrange the slices on top.                          Bake until the cheese and tomatoes are softened and the crust is golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.                          Garnish the pizza with the remaining parmesan, the remaining 1/3 cup basil and the red pepper flakes. Drizzle with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil and slice the pizza into 8 wedges.
