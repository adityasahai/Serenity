Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.

Place on paper towels to absorb grease & let cool.   Set the skillet/saute pan that you just fried the bacon in aside; you will use it again next.  Cut the bacon into small pieces: Now would be a good time to start boiling your water for the grits.   Pour the bacon grease out of the pan except for about a tablespoon. Over medium heat, cook shrimp, mushrooms & garlic, stirring until shrimp just begin to turn pink--approximately 3 minutes.   Sprinkle with Old Bay Seasoning & pepper (to taste) while you're cooking the shrimp. Add onions & bacon, stirring & cooking for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat. Boil 5 cups of water in large saucepan. Once water is boiling, slowly stir in grits, salt & red pepper. Reduce heat to low & cover to simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until thickened. During last 5 minutes of cooking, add cheeses and stir.
