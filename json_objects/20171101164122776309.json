White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Season the chicken breasts with plenty of salt and pepper (add more than you think you will need...I put about 1/4 tsp of salt on each breast).  The salt not only seasons the chicken but will help draw moisture out of the skin, making it EXTRA CRISPYYYYYYY!Roast the chicken for 30-35 minutes (depending on the size of the breasts) until the interior reaches 155 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.  Turn the broiler on to high, and broil the skin for 2 minutes and make sure you don't take your eyes away from it (it can burn very quickly).  I like to keep the chicken in the center of the oven when broiling so I can watch.Now on to the sauce. In a large skillet, combine the stock, wine, and orange juice and reduce on high heat for about 10 minutes, until reduced to a thick consistency.  When you are ready to take your sauce off the heat, throw the herbs in, and serve it below your chicken (don't pour on top of your chicken or else you'll soak the crispy skin)!  Enjoy!!!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F.Set a wire cooling rack on top of a baking sheet, and lay your chicken breasts on the rack.
