Lasagna pairs well with medium-bodied red wine with higher acidity. Sangiovese, Montepulciano, and Chianti all fit the bill. The Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447010,"title":"Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo","description":"At 1,000 feet above sea level, Valle Reale's vineyards are nestled into one of Italy's most beautifulnational parks. This rich 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is made from the oldest estate vineyards,planted back in 1975 on soils rich in chalk, clay and pebbles. Harvested by hand in the second partof October, the grapes are gently pressed and macerated with the skins for 1012days to ensureideal color concentration and structure. After full malolactic fermentation in barrels, the wine ismatured for one more year in the same French barriques and then refined in bottle for another eightmonths.Valle Reale introduces the wine lover to a new breed of Montepulciano. Surprisingly concentrated,with silky tannins and layers of dark berry fruit and spices, this is a rich and aromatic Montepulcianod'Abruzzo. Fullbodiedand firm, yet supple, it is ready to be enjoyed with hearty pasta dishes,roasted poultry or lamb, and ribs.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447010-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/valle-reale-vigneto-di-popoli-montepulciano-dabruzzo-2006/104761"}]},"instructions":"Saute beef in a large, deep, oven-safe frying pan (cast iron if you have it) until browned. Add tomatoes with their juice, oregano, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.While the sauce is simmering, slice off about 8 thin slices of mozzarella and set aside. Chop the rest into small pieces and mix with ricotta and egg.Pour the sauce into a bowl and start assembling the lasagna: ladle about a cup of sauce back into the frying pan and lay 3 noodles on top. Ladle on another cup or so of sauce, then  cup of cheese mixture, then 2 cups of spinach. Repeat the layers three times, and the amounts are approximate so don't worry if you have a little more or less of anything for that last layer.Cover the frying pan and cook for about 20 minutes over medium heat.Turn on your broiler. Place the sliced mozzarella on top of the lasagna layers and put the frying pan under the broiler until the cheese melts, about 2-13 minutes (watch it carefully!)Sprinkle the lasagna with a little oregano and fresh pepper and cut into wedges to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Saute beef in a large, deep, oven-safe frying pan (cast iron if you have it) until browned.","ingredients":[{"id":23572,"name":"beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add tomatoes with their juice, oregano, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer.
