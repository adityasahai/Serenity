Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors.

Feel free to cut them in half again if you'd like smaller pieces in the finished onion dip [you should have about 5-6 cups of onions]. Heat the butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper, and saute for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for approximately 30 minutes more until the onions are somewhat browned. If you wish, you can cook them longer, until they caramelize [see Helpful Tips, below]. Allow the onions to cool, and strain the onions to drain them of any clinging oil and butter.Place cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Add the onions and mix well. Stir in chives. Serve at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the onions in half and then slice them into 1/8-inch thick half-rounds.
