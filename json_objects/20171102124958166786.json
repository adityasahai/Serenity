Put the broccoli florets in a microwave-safe bowl and add 2 tablespoons water. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until tender, about 3 minutes; set aside. Meanwhile, trim the broccoli stems and peel into wide ribbons using a vegetable peeler; transfer to a large bowl. Add the carrot, half each of the lime juice, cilantro and jalapenos, the brine and 3 tablespoons olive oil; toss. Drain the florets and rinse under cold water; add to the salad and toss.                          Combine the tomatoes, onion and remaining lime juice, cilantro and jalapenos in a bowl. Mix half of the salsa with the meatloaf.                          Divide the meatloaf mixture among the tortillas, spreading it on one side. Top with the cheese, then fold the tortillas in half over the filling. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches and re-oiling the skillet as needed, cook the quesadillas until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts, 5 minutes. Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve with the sour cream, remaining salsa, lime wedges and broccoli salad.                          Combine the meatloaf mix, panko, eggs, 3/4 cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, the scallions, parsley, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until just combined. Form into a 5-by-9-inch loaf.                          Transfer the meatloaf to a 6-quart slow cooker. Scatter the potatoes and carrots over and around the meatloaf. Pour in the chicken broth. Cover the slow cooker and cook 8 hours on low or 4 hours on high.                          When the meatloaf is done, skim off any excess fat from the juices in the slow cooker. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and the brown sugar in a small bowl, then whisk in 1/4 cup juices from the slow cooker. Brush the top of the meatloaf with the ketchup mixture. Cover the slow cooker and let the meatloaf rest, 10 minutes.                          Remove the meatloaf from the slow cooker and slice in half. Serve half with the vegetables; top with more parsley.
