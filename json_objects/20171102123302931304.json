A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430034,"title":"NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port","description":"An amazing after dinner aperitif.
