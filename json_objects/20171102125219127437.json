Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350°F. Put the pita cubes on a small baking sheet and drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Use your hands to massage the oil over the pita cubes and spread them out in one layer. Bake about 8 minutes or until crispy. If you're not using the spiced cinnamon walnuts spread the walnut halves out on a baking sheet and bake 8 minutes. Cool and chop.      In a medium mixing bowl toss the apples with the lime juice. Add the scallions, parsley, red pepper (if using plain walnuts - skip if using the spiced cinnamon walnuts), cheese, pita and walnuts. Toss well. Drizzle with olive oil and toss again. Season to taste with salt and pepper and a little honey if needed. Best served fresh or the same day it's made.
