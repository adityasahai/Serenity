French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
