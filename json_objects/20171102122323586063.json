Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In your food processor, combine the spinach and garlic and pulse until small pieces remain. You dont want it completely pureed, but you want it to look as if the spinach is chopped. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and add half of the feta (2 ounces), pulsing again just a few times.In a bowl, mix together the chicken, egg, worcestershire, spinach mixture, salt, pepper, oregano and 1/3 cup breadcrumbs with your hands until just combined. If it feels too wet and is difficult to shape into balls, add a touch more breadcrumbs and mix. Add in the remaining feta cheese and mix. Form into 30 or so mini meatballs, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Place on the parchment and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.While the meatballs are cooking, spiralize the zucchini into noodles. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add olive oil and butter. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute, the stir in the lemon juice. Add the zoodles and toss well to coat. Cook until the noodles softened slightly, tossing often, for about 5 to 6 minutes.To serve, serve the meatballs on a bed of zoodles.
