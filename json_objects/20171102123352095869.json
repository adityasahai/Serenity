A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Sandeman Vintage Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 135 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430502,"title":"Sandeman Vintage Port","description":null,"price":"$135.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430502-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/1970-Sandeman-Vintage-Port-750/dp/B00FH1O8KK"}]},"instructions":"To make the tangerine curd: place the tangerine zest and juice in a saucepan and bring to the boil, reduce by half before mixing in the caster sugar and chopped butter. Once the butter has melted, let it cool for a few minutes then gradually mix in the egg yolks. Stir over a low heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened. This stage can also be achieved in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring continuously for 20-25 minutes until thickened. Once thickened transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool slightly before covering with cling film or greaseproof paper. Alternatively, store in a sterilised jar.To make the ice cream: whisk the crème fraîche and yogurt into the curd and flavour with Grand Marnier. The mix can now be churned in an ice cream maker for 20 minutes before freezing. An alternative method is to freeze the mix for several hours without churning, but you do need to stir it every 20 minutes to break up the crystals until it sets properly. If this second method is followed, remove the ice cream from the freezer about 20-30 minutes before serving to loosen its consistency.To make the syrup: boil together the tangerine zest and juice with the caster sugar and allow to reduce by a third before adding the Grand Marnier. Mix the arrowroot or cornflour with the orange juice or water and whisk into the simmering syrup. Once returned to a gentle simmer, cook for just 2 minutes before removing from the heat. The candied orange peel, if using, can be added while the syrup is warm. Allow to cool. An alternative method is to reheat the syrup just before serving, adding the peel while the syrup is warming.To make the meringues: preheat the oven to 120C/Gas ½/fan oven 100C. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually whisk in two-thirds of the caster sugar. Continue to whisk to reach stiff peaks. The remaining sugar can now be added. Continue to whisk until the meringue has a good thick creamy consistency. The cornflour and lemon juice can now be whisked in, whisking for another minute.The meringues can be kept naturally shaped by spooning individual portions on to lightly oiled parchment paper on a baking tray. Or spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/½in plain tube and piping large domes onto the paper. Whichever choice is made, it is important to leave ample space between the meringues to allow them to swell and rise. These can now be baked for 45-50 minutes, about 1 hour maximum. During this time they will take on a light colour, forming a crisp shell that coats the marshmallow centre. The meringues can be cooked at a higher temperature - 150C/Gas 2/fan oven 130C - to give slightly more colour. If so, cooking time will be slightly less, around 40-45 minutes.When assembling the dish there are two options: if dome-shaped meringues have been made, it is best to crack the tops, placing five or six tangerine segments on top of each if using. The ice cream can now be scooped or scrolled using a warm tablespoon, before sitting on top of the meringue. The syrup with candied fruit can now be drizzled over to finish. The alternative is to simply sit the ice cream and meringue side by side, decorating with segments, if using, and drizzling over the syrup. Whichever you choose, either can be finished with a light dusting of icing sugar, if desired, and perhaps a leaf or sprig of holly.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the tangerine curd: place the tangerine zest and juice in a saucepan and bring to the boil, reduce by half before mixing in the caster sugar and chopped butter.
