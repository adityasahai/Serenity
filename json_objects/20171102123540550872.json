Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.
