over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook until soft, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.                          Whisk together the Parmesan, parsley, oregano, eggs, 3 tablespoons cold water, the sauteed garlic and onions and some salt and pepper in a large bowl until combined. Add the chuck and pork and gently mix together until combined. Begin adding breadcrumbs a few tablespoons at a time until the mixture just holds together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. The longer you let the mixture sit, the more the flavor develops.                          For the fresh pasta: In a food processor, combine the flour and eggs. Pulse until it comes together as a dough. Remove and knead until smooth. Let rest for at least 30 minutes.                          For the tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to high, add the tomatoes and oregano and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning (adding a pinch of sugar if needed) and stir in the basil.                          Form the meatball mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Heat the remaining 1 cup of oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the meatballs and fry until golden brown on all sides.                          Add the meatballs to the sauce, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the meatballs have cooked through and the sauce has thickened more, about 15 minutes longer.                          To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.                          Roll out the dough in portions using a pasta roller. Cut out spaghetti using a pasta cutter and place the fresh pasta on a tray lined with parchment.                          Boil the pasta until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss the pasta with some of the warm sauce and a little bit of pasta water in a saute pan.                          Transfer the sauced pasta to a platter and top with the meatballs (using a slotted spoon). Ladle the remaining tomato sauce over the spaghetti and meatballs. Dollop ricotta on top and grate lots of Parmesan over the top. Garnish with fresh basil sprigs and parsley leaves.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the tomato sauce","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds.
