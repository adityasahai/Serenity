Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 33 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441958,"title":"Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The wine at first has a light ruby color. It has aromas of black cherry/cherry and violets with the characteristic Bien Nacido dried herbs and light pepper spice balanced by the toasty oak spice and vanilla influence of French oak barrel aging. There are flavors of cherry and red berry with dried herbs followed by a light pepper spice. The sweet oak spice and vanilla is nicely balanced by the fruit flavors. The wine is concentrated and elegant with a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.","price":"$33.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441958-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/sanctuary-bien-nacido-vineyard-pinot-noir-2007/109741"}]},"instructions":"Cook the corn on the cob until just tender. In my opinion the best way to cook corn for this recipe is to grill it. To grill the corn, remove the husks and silk. Place on the grill and close the lid. Turn every 5 minutes or so until cooked and beginning to char in places.In a bowl mix together the mayonnaise, salt, and garlic powder. Spread a thin layer on the mayo on each ear of corn. Top with queso fresco and chile powder. Squeeze fresh lime juice on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the corn on the cob until just tender.
