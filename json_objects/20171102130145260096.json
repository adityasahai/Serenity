Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Add vanilla and mix, scraping the bowl a few times to make sure that the butter and powdered sugar are completely incorporated. Mix in salt and flour until combined, then stir in the ginger. Note about the ginger: you can muddle the ginger before adding it or not, your choice. I did a combination of both.Turn out dough onto a sheet of waxed paper. Form dough into a 9 log and roll up in the wax paper sheet. Chill for 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 350F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silpat baking mat.Unroll the log of shortbread dough and slice into 18 rounds. Place cookies on prepared cookie sheet (they will not spread much).Bake for 9-12 minutes, until they start to turn golden, depending on how soft you want them. I cooked mine 10 minutes for a pillowy soft shortbread, but if you want it more cooked then bake them an additional 2 minutes or so. Cool completely before dipping.To dip, melt chocolate in a small bowl according to package directions. Dip half of each cookie in the chocolate and place it on a wax paper (or silpat) lined cookie sheet. Chill to set. Store cookies at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to one month.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cream butter and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer (or using a hand mixer).","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add vanilla and mix, scraping the bowl a few times to make sure that the butter and powdered sugar are completely incorporated.","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix in salt and flour until combined, then stir in the ginger.
