Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tramin Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448227,"title":"Tramin Pinot Grigio","description":"Bright yellow in color with coppery reflections and clear fruit aromas of pear, citrus, honeysuckle, tropical fruits and light spices.

Drizzle in the oil while running the processor. Mix in the wasabi powder and salt.                          For the pear and endive salad: Slice the Asian pear thinly on a mandolin and cut the slices into julienne. Separate and stack the endive leaves and cut into julienne. Cut the chives into lengths to match the pear and endive pieces. Mix the endive, pear and chives in a small bowl and toss with the lemon juice.                          For the fried oysters: Shuck the oysters, keeping one-half of each shell for plating. Dredge each oyster in the flour, shaking off the excess. Dip in the egg wash and then coat in the panko.                          Fill a straight-sided saute pan with 1 inch of canola oil and heat over medium-high heat until rippling. Fry the oysters until golden brown, 2 minutes.                          To plate: place each oyster shell on a bed of rock salt. Add a dollop of aioli to each shell and a little of the pear and endive salad.
