Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            For the Roasted Chili Vinaigrette: Combine all vinaigrette ingredients in a bowl and stir vigorously to mix.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To Finish: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
