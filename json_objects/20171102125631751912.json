Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Bellafina Prosecco with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":461572,"title":"Bellafina Prosecco","description":"Intensely aromatic and crisp on the palate, with aromas and flavorsof yellow apple, white peach, pear and notes of white flowers.Excellent as an aperitif, it is a perfect accompaniment to hors-d'oeuvres and delicate first courses.

Continue whisking until the eggs are nice and frothy. Set aside.In a large skillet (nonstick preferred) over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the sausages and brown 1 minute on each side. Add the tomato and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the egg mixture and cook, without stirring, until the eggs just begin to set, about 1 minute. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, gently push the eggs around the pan, letting any uncooked egg run onto the bottom of the pan.When the eggs are about half-cooked, after 1 to 2 minutes more, add the spinach, kale, half of the chopped basil and cheese. Stir gently to combine and continue cooking until the eggs are completely set but are still moist, about 1 minute more. Serve the scramble in 4 portions, top with basil and more cheese if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt and pepper.
