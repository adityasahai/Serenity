Butter 22 muffin cups in 2 muffin tins generously.Make the cookie base. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, allspice, and pepper. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. I did this by hand, but a hand or stand mixer would work as well. Mix in the cane syrup or molasses and egg until once again light and fluffy. Stir in flour mixture just until a very thick dough is formed. Take a couple tablespoons of dough and press them into the bottom of each muffin cup, making sure to cover it completely. Press an Oreo gently but firmly into the center of each muffin cup with cookie dough.Make the blondies. In a medium bowl, stir together flour and salt. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. I also did this by hand, but a hand or stand mixer would work as well. Add in the eggs and vanilla and mix until once again light and fluffy. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Spoon batter over Oreo cookies and cookie base, covering completely and filling just to the top of the muffin cup. Bake for about 30 minutes, rotating halfway through if necessary, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the blondies comes out with only a few moist crumbs. Cool completely in pan. When cool, gently loosen from pans and enjoy! May be stored in airtight containers at room temperature for up to 3 days, or frozen, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in zipper bags for up to 4 months. Thaw at room temperature for several hours or in a 350 degree F oven for about 15 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
