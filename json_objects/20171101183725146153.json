Roll out your pie crust to a 12-inch circle then press it into a 9-inch pie plate. Flute the edges and place in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Remove chilled pie crust from the freezer and line the bottom with foil or parchment paper.
