Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan and drop in the pearl onions. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the onions are very tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain and set aside.2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the cheese log in the chopped herbs.3. Layer the phyllo sheets on a piece of parchment paper, brushing each sheet lightly with melted butter. Work quickly so that the phyllo doesn’t dry out or it will crack when you roll it.4. Place the goat cheese log along the long edge of the stacked phyllo. Tuck the ends of the dough over the ends of the log. Using the parchment paper as a guide, roll up the dough tightly, completely enclosing the goat cheese. Brush the roll with melted butter and egg wash, and score into portions, cutting one-third the depth of the strudel. Place on the parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown.5. To make the vinaigrette, combine the red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Whisk in the olive oil.6. Toss together the roasted peppers, simmered onions, and half the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper to taste. In a separate bowl, toss the salad greens with the remaining vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper.7. For each portion, arrange the dressed salad greens on one side of a plate and a small mound of the pepper salad on the other. Slice the phyllo log and serve on the pepper salad.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan and drop in the pearl onions.
