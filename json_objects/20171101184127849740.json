Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maso Canali Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes.

Place the cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of the chili flakes and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a bowl and mix to combine. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle with half the salt mixture, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Roast, turning halfway, for 20 minutes or until golden.                                                                            Place the quinoa, lime zest, remaining chili flakes, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix to combine.

Dip the fish into the egg and press into the quinoa mixture to coat. Cook for 23 minutes on each side or until golden and cooked through.
