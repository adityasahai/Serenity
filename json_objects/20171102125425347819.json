Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 450F.

Lightly spritz (or brush) both sides with olive oil and season both sides with salt and pepper.Bake until golden brown on both sides, 8 to 9 minutes per side. Transfer all but the largest 8 rounds of eggplant to a plate.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the cheeses and basil.Make stacks by ladling 1 tablespoon marinara sauce onto each of the 8 eggplant slices on the baking sheet. Top with 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture and 2 spinach leaves. Repeat to make a second layer and finish each stack with a third eggplant slice.
