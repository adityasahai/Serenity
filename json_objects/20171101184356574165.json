Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silpat mats.2.  In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt.  In a separate, small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup of sugar and the cinnamon; set both bowls aside.3.  In a large bowl, use electric mixer to beat butter and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar until blended together (about 1 minute).  Add eggs and vanilla extract; mix until blended (about 1 minute).  Add flour mixture and mix just until incorporated.  Stir in chocolate chips and toffee pieces.4.  Scoop out a heaping Tablespoonful of dough and use your hands to roll it into a ball.  Roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Place cookies 3 inches apart on the cookie sheets (I baked 8 at a time and found that was perfect).  5.  Bake cookies until edges are golden, centers are still golden and no longer look raw in the middle- about 16 minutes.  Cool cookies on baking sheet for at least 5 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
