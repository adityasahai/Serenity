If the peanut butter comes out of the top, just grab some extra dough to fill in the gap. Once you have a ball of dough with the peanut butter in the center, flatten the ball slightly and then drop into the pretzels crumbs. You can coat one side or all over (I did a bit of both). Repeat with remaining dough, then bake for about 11 minutes.
