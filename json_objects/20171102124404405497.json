Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Alamos Malbec Mendoza Seleccion with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":443245,"title":"Alamos Malbec Mendoza Seleccion","description":"Malbec is the \"signature wines of the Mendoza region, representing the greatest achievements of Argentine winemaking, and Alamos Seleccion Malbec is the pinnacle of Alamos winemaking. The nose is full of ripe black fruits with floral tones and touches of leather, vanilla, and spice. The mouthfeel is full yet supple, with juicy black raspberry, black cherry and black currant fruit flavors layered with notes of violets, black pepper and anise. The finish is long and lingering, with soft, velvety tannins and bright, refreshing acidity.","price":"$16.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/443245-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/alamos-malbec-mendoza-seleccion-2009/106171"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Combine the ground beef, Italian sausage and Italian seasoning in a bowl. Knead the mixture together and form it into four large/thick patties.                          Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the burgers on one side for several minutes, then turn the burgers. Lay 2 slices of provolone on each patty, followed by 4 slices of pepperoni. Add a couple of thin slices of red onion, a slice of green bell pepper and a pile of black olives. Spoon a little marinara sauce on top, then lay another slice of cheese on top of all the fillings.                          Place the lid on the skillet and allow the burgers to cook all the way through while the cheese melts and the pepperoni warms.                          Split the rolls and toast them in butter in a skillet until nice and golden and crisp. Spread both halves with more marinara sauce and sprinkle the sauce with Parmesan.                          Lay the patties on the bottom buns, then top with the top buns. Serve immediately; hearty appetites are recommended!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the ground beef, Italian sausage and Italian seasoning in a bowl.
