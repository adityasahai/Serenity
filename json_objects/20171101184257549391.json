White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

Add onion, celery and carrots, and cook until onion is soft. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.Add whole chicken legs, broth and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Add rice at this point for the shorter cooking method. Cover and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, at least 30 minutes (45 if you use brown rice). Or for the longer cooking method, for a richer broth, simmer the chicken legs on their own for 30 minutes, then add the rice and cook until tender (30-45 minutes more).Remove chicken using a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, use two forks to shred it into bite sized pieces. Discard bones.Stir shredded chicken back into soup, along with chopped parsley.
