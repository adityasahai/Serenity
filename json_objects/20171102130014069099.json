With your mixer on low medium speed (with the beater attachment), mix all together.Add oil and mix until a cohesive dough forms.The dough should be just enough to hold its shape when you try to roll into a ball. If they look more like crumbs, add a little bit more oil (10-15 ml) at a time.Weigh the dough to make 0.4 oz/10 g (1 inch cookies) OR 0.7 oz/20 g (1½ inch cookies) rounded portion and roll it into a ball with your palms. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and repeat until all the dough is used up. You can make a 10 gram ball using a tsp. measuring spoon.(OPTIONAL) If you want to put a piece of almond on the cookie, hold the cookie ball on your palm and gently press the almond into the dough.Using a pastry brush, lightly glaze the top of the cookie balls with the beaten egg yolk.Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cookies become slightly golden. Let them cool on a wire rack and store in an air tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 355 degrees F (180C).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":355.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine all the dry ingredients in a stand mixer.
