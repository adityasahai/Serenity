Toss the green beans, oil, and a pinch of salt and black pepper together. Spread in an even layer on a baking sheet and roast until golden in places, about 15 to 20 minutes, tossing once halfway through.While the green beans roast, make the dressing. To do so, whisk together all ingredients except the water; gradually add the water a little at a time while whisking until it reaches your desired consistency and salt level (the water is here not only to achieve the right consistency, but also to make the dressing not too salty).When the green beans are done roasting, assemble the salad. Spread the spring mix out on a serving platter and top with the roasted green beans and all remaining ingredients. Serve along with the dressing for drizzling on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To roast the green beans, preheat the oven to 425F.
