Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples.
