Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Set asideCream butter and sugar until well combined. Add in eggs, mixing well after each addition.Stir in yogurt and honey.Slowly add in flour mixture and mix until well combineChill for one hour or up to overnightPreheat oven to 375, prepare cookie sheets with parchment or silicone bake mats.Once dough is chilled, scoop about a tablespoon sized ball for the mushroom caps. Roll the dough balls round in your hands and then make an indent on the bottom with the end of a small round wooden spoon handle. Gently press so you don’t squish the dough too much. Place bottom side down on baking sheet.For the stems roll about a half of a tablespoon of dough about an inch and a half long with one end pointed and the other slightly flat. Place stems on a separate baking sheet from the capsBake 10-12 minutes for caps. 8-10 for stems, if the holes in the caps close up, once cooled, scrape a little back out with a sharp knife, just enough to fit the pointed end of the stem in it. Match up stems and caps so they are ready to “glue” together.For the icing:Combine sugar, water and lemon juice. Dip pointed end of stems in the icing, let excess drip off and insert into indent in caps. Place cap side down and let fully dry.Add cocoa to the remaining icing and mix. Carefully dip the caps in the icing and lie on a wire drying rack and let fully dry. These keep well at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week or frozen for several months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine flour, soda and spices in a medium bowl.
