Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428399,"title":"Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot","description":"Working without sourcing constraints, our winemakers selected Merlot clusters contributing layered flavors of dark berries, licorice and espresso alongside lots of richness, full-bodied structure, and desirable length. In addition to these flavors, you'll taste hints of cigar paper, cocoa, caramel and nutmeg wrapped around a remarkably smooth mid-palate full of velvety texture and depth. On the long finish, you'll find suggestions of toasty oak, mouth-filling black fruit, and cola framed by plush tannins.","price":"$26.65","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428399-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Pines-County-Sonoma-Merlot/dp/B01A8WOVRW"}]},"instructions":"Spread half the jalapenos over one side of the flank steak.  Add the oil, garlic, cilantro, thyme or oregano.  Roll the steak up and place it into a large zipper lock bag.  Add the remaining jalapenos and their juice, as well as the remaining olive oil.Close the bag and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  Heat grill over high heat and coat with non-stick spray.  Remove the steak from the marinade and shake off any jalapenos clinging to the surface.  Sprinkle both sides with salt and grill 8 to 10 minutes per side turning once until the steak is still pinkish red in the center.  Transfer to a plate and rest 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.Slice the steak against the grain and serve immediately.  Leftovers make great fajitas, simply allow the sliced steak to cool completely before storing in the fridge in an air-tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Spread half the jalapenos over one side of the flank steak.","ingredients":[{"id":23657,"name":"flank steak","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flank-steak.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the oil, garlic, cilantro, thyme or oregano.","ingredients":[{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cilantro.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Roll the steak up and place it into a large zipper lock bag.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the remaining jalapenos and their juice, as well as the remaining olive oil.Close the bag and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Heat grill over high heat and coat with non-stick spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Remove the steak from the marinade and shake off any jalapenos clinging to the surface.
