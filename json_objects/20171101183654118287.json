White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.
