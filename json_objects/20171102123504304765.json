my top picks for Tacos. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 43 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Make the salsa: Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the chiles, tomato, 2 cups water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium; simmer until the chiles are soft and tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.                          Remove the bay leaf, then transfer the vegetables and about 1 cup cooking liquid to a blender and puree until smooth, adding more cooking liquid if necessary. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve back into the pan; cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Set aside.                          Make the tacos: Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy saute pan (do not use a nonstick pan) over medium-high heat. Add the potato and saute until golden, 8 to 10 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add the pork to the pan, season with pepper and sear until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Add 1 cup of the prepared salsa and return the potato to the pan; cover and simmer until the pork is fork-tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Serve in tortillas; top with more salsa, cilantro, onion and radishes.
