Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Place spaghetti squash on parchment, cut side-up and sprinkle with salt. Cover with foil and bake until fork tender, about 1 hour.Let spaghetti squash sit a few minutes until cool enough to handle, then shred flesh with a fork. Transfer squash flesh to a large bowl and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the onion and cool until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour and mustard powder and stir with a whisk until it makes a thick paste. Slowly pour the milk into the pan while whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, then cook for a few minutes until thickened, stirring frequently. Add the cheddar cheese, salt and pepper and stir until smooth.Pour the cheese mixture into the large bowl with the spaghetti squash and toss until combined. Divide evenly into the 4 squash skins.Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Add the panko bread crumbs and stir until all the bread crumbs are moistened.
