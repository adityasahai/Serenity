Normally I fry mine and leave the yolks just a little runny, but any way you like your eggs will work! About 1 or 2 minutes before your eggs are done pop the toast under the broiler to get them all toasty and warm (WATCH CLOSE!!!). Remove the toast and then drizzle with a little honey.When the eggs are ready, top each piece of toast with an egg. Zest some fresh lemon over top, sprinkle with salt and pepper.
