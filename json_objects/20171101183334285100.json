Stir & let rest until bubbly/frothy; about 3-5 minutes.Add oil & whisked egg to the water mixture.  In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, salt, & cinnamon.  With the dough hook on the stand mixer, gradually add dry ingredients to the mixer while it's running on low.  Add cinnamon chips.  Once all the dry ingredients have been added & the dough has balled up.  Turn the machine to medium speed for 5 minutes.  The dough should clean the sides of the bowl.  If not, add flour 1 Tbsp at a time.After kneading, take the dough out, grease the mixer bowl & put the dough back in.  Cover with a towel & let rise until double in size (about 45 min.)Grease a bread pan & shape the bread dough to fit inside.  Cover with a towel again & let rise until it reaches the top of the pan or double in size (about 20-30 minutes.)Bake at 350*F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top.  Let rest in the pan for a few minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.  Store in a plastic bag to keep from drying out.  Best if eaten within 2-3 days.*If kneading by hand: Leave cinnamon chips out of the kneading step (#3).  Let it rest for 45 minutes (step #4).  Then gently knead in the cinnamon chips before placing the dough into the greased bread pan to rise.  The cinnamon chips melt if you knead it with your warm hands, so save this for the last steps as just described.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine warm water, yeast & sugar in a stand mixer bowl.
