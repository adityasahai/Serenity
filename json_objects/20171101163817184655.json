Stir and let stand for 10 minutes.  Set remaining  cup of oats aside for later.After 15 minutes, add the remaining ingredients (bread flour, whole wheat flour, milk, honey, butter, salt and yeast) to the bowl.Stir on low speed for 3-4 minutes, or until dough begins to come together.Increase speed to medium and mix for 3-4 more minutes.Transfer dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl.  Cover and place in a warm (85F) location for 1 hour.Turn dough out onto a lightly floured countertop and fold several times.  Place dough back into bowl, cover and let rest in a warm location for 1 more hour.Divide the dough into 2 pieces of equal weight and shape each piece into a loose ball.Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape the dough into a 9\"x9\" square.  Fold the dough into thirds (like a letter) and pinch the seam closed.  Place the dough seam-side down into a greased 9\"x5\" loaf pan.  Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.Spray the tops of the loaves (in the bread pan) with baking spray or olive oil and sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup of oats evenly on top of the loaves.  (Tip: Press the oats gently into the top of the dough until they stick.)  Cover pans loosely and place in a warm location.  Let rest for 1 hour, or until loaves have risen about 1 over the top of loaf pan.Preheat oven to 425F and bake for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 400F and continue baking for another 15 minutes.Let loaves cool for 20 minutes in the pans and then turn loaves out onto cooling rack until fully cooled.  (Tip: This bread freezes well.  Just wrap loaves tightly in plastic wrap once cooled and freeze until needed.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Using the bowl of a countertop mixer, add 1 cups of oats and water.
