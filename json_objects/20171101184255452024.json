A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Using snowflake cutters of various sizes, stamp out 3 snowflake shapes. Lay the snowflakes on baking parchment on a flat surface and leave overnight to harden. Keep any trimmings and wrap up in cling film.Next day, make the royal icing. Drop a writing tube into a piping bag and spoon in a third of the icing. Spread the rest around the base of the cake to create a snowdrift effect. Pipe snowflake outlines over the cut-out snowflake shapes and pipe snowflakes all over the surface of the cake in different sizes and designs. Leave for 1 hr until the icing has hardened slightly, then sprinkle silver lustre over the cake, snowdrift and snowflakes. Using the leftover ready-to-roll white icing, mould thimble-sized supports for your snowflakes to lean against. Position the snowflakes on the top of the cake. Finally, fix the silver balls to the icing with a little more of the royal icing. Finish by scattering sparkles over.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Knead the ready-to-roll icing until smooth, then roll out to approx 1cm thickness.
