Cover and pulse for about 20 to 30 seconds or until the mixture is finely ground, but not pasty.Sift the remaining flour and salt together into a medium bowl. Stir in the almond mixture until the ingredients are mixed. Set aside.Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners’ sugar in an electric mixer bowl at medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low speed and gradually beat in the flour mixture, beating until just combined. Stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Shape the dough into a disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until the dough is firm.Heat the oven to 300 degrees and position the rack in the center of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4-inch thickness, adding only enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Cut with a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter. Place the rounds about 1/2-inch apart. Bake 1 sheet at a time for about 20 minutes or until the shortbread is lightly browned underneath. Remove immediately to wire racks to cool.Cool the shortbread completely. Put the chocolate and water in a microwavable bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes, stirring after the first minute. Dip one-half of each cookie into the melted chocolate and place them on a rack over a cookie sheet to catch any drippings. While chocolate is still soft, place a slivered almond on top of each cookie. Refrigerate for 1 hour to set chocolate. Store shortbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place 2 tablespoons of the flour, almonds, thyme leaves and lemon zest in an electric food processor bowl fitted with a metal blade.
