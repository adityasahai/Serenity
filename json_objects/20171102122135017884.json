Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"COOK THE PASTA: Boil the pasta insalted water for 8 minutes then addthe peas, return the water to theboil and cook for 2 minutes moreuntil the pasta and peas are tender.Tip into a colander over the sink,cool the pasta and peas under thecold tap then drain really well.MAKE THE DRESSING: While thepasta is boiling roughly chop thetomato and put in a food processorwith half the sun-dried tomatoes,the olive oil, vinegar, garlic andabout 8 basil leaves.
