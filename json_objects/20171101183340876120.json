Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"Save RecipePrint Recipe                          Israeli Salad with Feta and Mint                                        Ingredients1 lb Persian cucumbers, diced1 lb ripe red tomatoes, seeded and diced1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced1/2 cup chopped fresh mint3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil3 tbsp fresh lemon juice1/4 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp salt, or more to taste1 cup crumbled feta cheese                                                        Total Time: 15 Minutes          Servings: 8 side, 2 main          Kosher Key: Dairy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Save Recipe","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Print Recipe","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Israeli Salad with Feta and Mint","ingredients":[{"id":1019,"name":"feta cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mint.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Ingredients1 lb Persian cucumbers, diced1 lb ripe red tomatoes, seeded and diced1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced1/2 cup chopped fresh mint3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil3 tbsp fresh lemon juice1/4 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp salt, or more to taste1 cup crumbled feta cheese","ingredients":[{"id":11951,"name":"yellow pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yellow-bell-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11821,"name":"red pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-bell-pepper.png"},{"id":1019,"name":"feta cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg"},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cucumber.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Total Time: 15 Minutes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Servings: 8 side, 2 main","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Kosher Key: Dairy","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
