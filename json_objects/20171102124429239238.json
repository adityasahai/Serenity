Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Add the pumpkin to a large bowl, drizzle with 2 tablespoons coconut oil, and toss to coat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and then spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and roast, tossing once, until golden brown and tender, 50 to 60 minutes.                          Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon coconut oil to a Dutch oven over medium heat, and allow to melt. Add the onions and saute until tender, 3 minutes. Add the garlic and Swiss chard, and saute until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the poultry seasoning and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.                          Add the cream cheese and milk to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Heat until the cream cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat.                          In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, 1 1/2 cups each of the Gruyere and Parmesan, and some salt and pepper. Stir to combine, then set aside.                          Ladle 1/2 cup of the cream cheese sauce into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, spreading with a spatula to cover the bottom. Add a single layer of noodles, and then layer with half of the remaining cream cheese sauce, half of the chard mixture and half of the pumpkin. Add a second layer of noodles, and then half of the ricotta mixture and all of the pesto. Add a third layer of noodles, followed by the remaining cream cheese sauce, chard and pumpkin. Add a fourth, and final, layer of noodles, and spread with the remaining ricotta mixture.                          Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, and transfer to the oven. Bake until the noodles are soft and the cheese is hot and melty, 55 to 60 minutes.                          Remove the baking dish from the oven and turn on the broiler. Remove the foil from the baking dish. Top the lasagna with the remaining grated Gruyere and Parmesan. Broil until golden brown and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.                          Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.                          Add the garlic and pecans to a food processor, and pulse to a thick paste. Add the lemon zest, basil, Gouda and 1 teaspoon salt, and pulse to chop up the basil leaves; this will be very thick. With the motor running, drizzle in 2/3 cup of the olive oil; if you want the sauce thinner, add the remaining oil. Add the lemon juice, and pulse to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the pumpkin to a large bowl, drizzle with 2 tablespoons coconut oil, and toss to coat.
