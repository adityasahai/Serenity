Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook the pasta in salted water al dente, according to package directions.While pasta is cooking, brown the sausage. Remove the casings, brown and crumble the sausages like you would ground beef.Add the onions and garlic to the sausage and saute for a couple of minutes.Pour in the entire can of diced tomatoes and the tomato sauce and heat through.Pour in the cream and heat through. The longer you cook the sauce the thicker it will get so simmer it until it is the consistency you want.Add the fresh basil and let it simmer for a few minutes.Finally, mix the sausage sauce with the pasta and serve. Top each serving with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Serve with crusty garlic bread.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the pasta in salted water al dente, according to package directions.While pasta is cooking, brown the sausage.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the casings, brown and crumble the sausages like you would ground beef.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onions and garlic to the sausage and saute for a couple of minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour in the entire can of diced tomatoes and the tomato sauce and heat through.","ingredients":[{"id":11549,"name":"tomato sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Pour in the cream and heat through.
