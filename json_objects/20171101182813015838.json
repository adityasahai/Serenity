Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Blend the sorghum with the paprika in a small dish with a whisk and set aside.2. Cook bacon slices in a large skillet until the meat begins to brown slightly and the fat is still not cooked all the way through (you do not want the bacon to be fully cooked since it will cook further in the oven).  Use a bacon press to keep the bacon slices flat, if you have one.  Remove the bacon.  Drain on paper towels, patting the excess fat.3. Place an oiled wire rack on top of a pan that has been lined with aluminum foil (this will allow for an easier clean-up).  Place the bacon slices on the rack and brush both sides with the glaze.  Place in preheated oven and cook for about seven to ten minutes, checking after seven minutes.  You don't want the bacon to brown too quickly.  4. Before the bacon becomes completely brown and cooked, remove the pan and baste each slice again with the glaze, on both sides.  Return to the oven and cook for another two to four minutes.  Again, check to be sure the bacon is not browning too quickly.  The sugar in the sorghum can quickly cause the bacon to burn.5. Remove from the oven and let the bacon sit until it cools.  It will harden and crisp up as it cools.  Use in recipes, as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
