Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. One wine you could try is Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438039,"title":"Noble Vines 337 Lodi Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"337 Cabernet Sauvignon exudes vibrant aromas of black cherry, ripe currant, fresh herbs and lightly roasted coffee. Smooth tannins and balanced acidity support core flavors of blackberry, black cherry and chocolate, intertwined with spicy black pepper accents on the finish. This wine can be enjoyed on its own or with herb-roasted pork loin, baked chicken or barbecued steak and sauteed mushrooms.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438039-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/noble-vines-337-lodi-cabernet-sauvignon-2014/165669"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.                    Heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally. Once softened, add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, just until fragrant. Remove from heat and scrape the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Let cool slightly.                    To the bowl, add ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, 2 tablespoons ketchup, worcestershire sauce, egg, salt and pepper, and cheddar cubes. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.                    Shape the mixture into a loaf on the prepared baking sheet. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons of ketchup on top.                    Bake 40 - 45 minutes or until the inside reaches 160F. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400F.
