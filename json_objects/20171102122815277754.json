Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Selvapiana Chianti Rufina with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436167,"title":"Selvapiana Chianti Rufina","description":"This is a big and juicy Chianti Rufina, offering delicious strawberry and cherry aromas followed by subtle notes of spice box, leather, earth and mushrooms.
