Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. If you find the paper slides about too much you can always press a little of the cookie dough under the paper so the paper sticks the pan. It's a neat little trick to stop the paper from sliding around when you take the cookie sheets in and out of the oven.Sift together both of the flours, baking soda, and salt into a medium size bowl.In a separate bowl, combine the butter, peanut butter, and sugar. Use a stand mixer or hand mixer to cream the mixture together until it's light and fluffy.Now add the vanilla and egg while continuing to cream the mixture until it's smooth and fluffy. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes if using a mixer.Grab your flour mixture and mix that into creamy mixture by hand. You want to mix it just enough to incorporate it, do not over-mix it.Now drop the mixture by spoonfuls onto the cookies sheets. Leave about 2 inches in between each cookie, then press the cookies down to flatten them a bit, so that each one is about 2 inches wide.Place in the oven and bake for about 12 to 14 minutes, or until the cookies are golden in colour. Remove cookies from the oven and allow to cool on pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to allow them to cool completely.Cream the confectioners' sugar, butter, and peanut butter together in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth and you can't help but swipe some out of the bowl.Now add the heavy cream and continue to cream the ingredients together with a spatula until the mixture is smooth and really fluffy.Putting it all together:Match up the cookies by size and shape, they should look similar for each side of the sandwich cookie. Start filling each set with the peanut butter filling, use an offset spatula to smooth the mixture. Press each side of the cookie together slightly so the filling adheres to the cookies perfectly. You can then drizzle them with chocolate and/or confectioners' sugar.Serve with a big old peanut butter loving smile!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
