Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook linguine according to package directions in pot of boiling, salted water.Warm cream cheese, oil and lemon juice in saucepan over low heat.Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking water.  Stir reserved cooking water into cream cheese mixture.  Add pasta, lemon zest, and parsley; toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook linguine according to package directions in pot of boiling, salted water.Warm cream cheese, oil and lemon juice in saucepan over low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":10720420,"name":"linguine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spaghetti.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking water.  Stir reserved cooking water into cream cheese mixture. ","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add pasta, lemon zest, and parsley; toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper, if desired.","ingredients":[{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
