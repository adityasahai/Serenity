Cut open the bag and slice the dough into rectangles. If youve rolled it thinly enough and use all the dough, you should be able to get 34-38 rectangles. (Cut much bigger rectangles if you want regular-sized pop tarts, as opposed to minis.) Put a little fillingabout3/4 teaspoonon half the rectangles, then place remaining rectangles on top. Cinch down with a fork or your fingers, and its okay if some of the filling comes out. Bake 14-18 minutes, depending on how crispy you want the crust. Once cooled, spread on glaze (recipe at the bottom of this post), and store in a plastic container for soft pop tarts or a glass container for crispy ones.View Nutrition FactsAlso see above nutrition link for step-by-step pop tart making photos.For the healthy pop tarts glaze:Microwave (or heat on the stove) 1 small strawberry for 20 seconds, then mash very well until its like soup.
