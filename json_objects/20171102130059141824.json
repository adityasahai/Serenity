A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Pulse a few times to mix. Add diced butter and continue pulsing until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Add ice cold water gradually until the dough begins to come together. Remove dough from the bowl, form a disk with the dough, wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes.Place pineapple chunks, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract into a small saucepan. Place over low heat and stir occasionally cooks for 30 minutes, or until pineapple has softened and has released most of its juice. Mash the pineapple with a potato masher then transfer to a plate and allow it to cool.Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees FWhen ready, remove dough from the refrigerator. Sprinkle flour over your work surface and roll out the dough to cover a 9 inch tart pan. Line the pan with the dough and use rolling pin to cut off any excess dough. Transfer tart pan to the freezer for 10 minutes.When ready to assemble, remove tart pan lined with dough from the freezer. Cover bottom of tart evenly with the caramelized pineapple, and top with mango wedges forming a fan.Brush whole milk over the tart with a pastry brush, sprinkle with demerara sugar, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of diced butter over the top of the tart.Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the crust has a light golden brown hue to it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine flour, salt, and sugar in your food processor.
