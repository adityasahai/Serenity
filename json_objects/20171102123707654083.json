Try pairing with Albarino, rosé Wine, and Sauvignon Blanc. These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more. The Salneval Albarino with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":446012,"title":"Salneval Albarino","description":"Light straw in color, the nose of this Albariño is seductive with honey, pear and tropical fruit and a slight mineral component. It is racy andzesty with citrus and floral flavors in the mouth, yet is round and soft at the same time.It matches perfectly with fresh seafood and shellfish; is an ideal accompaniment to salty, spicy Asian cuisine; and is also great on its own as a cocktail wine. Truly adventurous food lovers will amaze and inspire their friends by serving it with the unlikely, but fantastic pairing of traditional barbequed ribs with a sweet, slightly spicy tomato based sauce.","price":"$9.39","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446012-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/salneval-albarino-2008/98474"}]},"instructions":"Start by processing the Brussels sprouts. Rinse well then cut into quarters. Cut off the bottom and toss out any browning or yellowing leaves. I used one pound of sprouts and only kept the green leaves and trimmed off any thick white areas on the leaves.Trim and cut one skinless boneless chicken breast. I cut into two cutlets, then cut length ways then lastly cut ¼ inch cross grain slices.Mix the spices. 1 tablespoon paprika, 2 t course salt and 1 t each of pepper, oregano and thyme. ¼ to ½ t Cayenne pepper.Heat 2 tsp oil over medium high heat in a large pan. I used a dutch oven. Add 1 T spice mixture to the chicken and coat well. Also coat the shrimp with 2 t of the spice mixture.When the oil is hot, add the chicken and saute for 5 minutes.While the chicken is sauteing, prep one medium onion and one green pepper by chopping. Cut 8 oz o f sausage into ¼ in medallions.After the chicken has cooked 5 minutes, add the onion, pepper and sausage. Also add 1 stack of chopped celery here if you want a more normal jambalaya.This will cook for 4 minutes then add 4 cloves of crushed garlic and cook 1 minute more.While the chicken mixture is cooking, in a fry pan over medium high heat melt 1 T butter. When hot, add the shrimp and 2 cloves of crushed garlic. Add the leaves of the Brussels sprouts if using. Saute for 2 minutes.When the chicken done, add the shrimp mixture.Add 1 – 10½ oz can of RoTel and 1½ cups of chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to boil.When boiling, add 2 cups of Minute Rice. Mix the rice in well. Remove from heat and cover for 5 minutes.Stir well and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by processing the Brussels sprouts.
