Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 43 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Place ancho chiles, pasilla chiles and unpeeled garlic in a microwave safe medium mixing bowl, pour 3 Tbsp water over peppers then microwave on high power, 2 - 3 minutes until peppers are soft and pliable. Meanwhile add chipotle peppers, yellow onion, 2 Tbsp olive oil, the honey, cider vinegar, oregano and 2 tsp salt to a food processor. Remove peppers from microwave and stem and seed them, then add to food processor. Peel garlic and add to food processor. Pulse mixture until well pureed. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour sauce into skillet (scrape out any excess with a spatula) and fry until well thickened and fragrant, about 7 - 8 minutes (it should be like a thick tomato paste). Pour in broth, bring to a boil then reduce heat slightly and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes (note that sauce can be made the night before and stored in the fridge to save prep time in the morning). Trim large pieces of fat from pork roast then cut into chunks (about 6 - 8). Season pork all over with salt and pepper (just keep in mind you can add more salt later but can't take it out, so go lightly with the salt, especially considering there's plenty in the sauce mixture). Place pork in slow cooker then pour sauce evenly over pork, submerge bay leaves and cinnamon stick into sauce. Cover and cook on high 5 hours, or until meat is tender. Remove bay leaves and cinnamon stick. Remove pork while leaving broth in slow cooker. Shred pork and remove any fat while shredding. Ladle out as much of the fat from the top layer of broth (the greasy layer on top) as you can, return shredded pork to broth mixture (at this point you can add more salt if desired) cover and cook 30 minutes on warm or low to allow flavors to infuse into each piece.Serve warm over tortillas with toppings listed.
