Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon. This wine is beautifully balanced with crisp acidity and an elegant lingering finish.","price":"$18.29","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432869-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/raymond-reserve-selection-chardonnay-2004/87725"}]},"instructions":"Carefully remove the sardines with a fork from the can.  The idea is to keep them whole.  Place then into a shallow flat container and squeeze the juice half a lemon over them.  Sprinkle them with half the parsley and 1 teaspoon of chives.  Season them with a pinch of pepper and salt.  Let them sit for 15 minutes.                                  While they are sitting attractively place the avocado into bowls.  Now place 4 to 6 sardines into each bowl and then scatter the radishes over the top.  Tuck in small bunches of cress.  Garnish with remaining chives and parsley.  Dress with a squeeze of lemon juice and some more olive oil.  Season with salt and fresh ground pepper and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Carefully remove the sardines with a fork from the can.
