Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; let cool slightly.                          Add the noodles and edamame to the boiling water. Cook until the noodles are al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and run under cold water until cool; add to the bowl with the mushrooms.                          Pulse all but a few cilantro leaves, the mint, scallions, 2 tablespoons water, the soy sauce, vinegar, Sriracha and sesame oil in a food processor until roughly chopped; toss with the noodles and edamame.
