Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Beat this mixture very well, until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.Add the whole egg, beat until combined, then add the remaining egg yolk and beat well.Next, slowly stream in the lemon juice while beating. The mixture may look curdled, but do not worry. Pour the mixture into a heavy-bottomed sauce pan and cook over low heat while stirring continuously and scrapping the sides of the pan. When the mixture coats the back of a spoon, in about 5-7 minutes, it is done.Remove from the heat, pour into a small bowl and press plastic wrap directly on the surface before placing it in the fridge to chill. (Can be made 1-2 days in advance).Next, make the cookies: preheat the oven to 350.Cream together the butter and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.Next, add the vanilla and continue beating. Sprinkle in the ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg and beat well.This is very important: slowly add the flour to the dough while mixing, about 1 tablespoon at a time. If you dump all of the flour in at once, the dough won't come together.Scoop the dough into 12 teaspoon-sized mounds. Use a chopstick to make a divot in the center of each cookie. Press the edges together if the dough cracks a bit.Bake for 13-14 minutes, or until the edges of cookies brown slightly.Move the cookies to a wire rack and cool completely.Add scoops of lemon curd into the center of each cookie, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, make the lemon curd: In a small bowl, beat together with an electric mixer the butter and sugar.
