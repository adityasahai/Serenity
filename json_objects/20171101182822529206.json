Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Wrap up the steamed rice in the dishtowel, twist it up, then SQUEEZE all the excess moisture out! It's amazing how much extra liquid will be released, which will leave you with a nice and dry pizza crust.In a large bowl, mix up your strained rice, beaten egg, goat cheese, and spices. (Don't be afraid to use your hands! You want it very well mixed.) It won't be like any pizza dough you've ever worked with, but don't worry-- it'll hold together!Press the dough out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (It's important that it's lined with parchment paper, or it will stick.) Keep the dough about \" thick, and make the edges a little higher for a \"crust\" effect, if you like.Bake for 35-40 minutes at 400F. The crust should be firm, and golden brown when finished.Now's the time to add all your favorites-- sauce, cheese, and any other toppings you like. Return the pizza to the 400F oven, and bake an additional 5-10 minutes, just until the cheese is hot and bubbly.Slice and serve immediately!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 400F.To make the cauliflower rice, pulse batches of raw cauliflower florets in a food processor, until a rice-like texture is achieved.Fill a large pot with about an inch of water, and bring it to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":10011135,"name":"cauliflower florets","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"},{"id":10111135,"name":"cauliflower rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the \"rice\" and cover; let it cook for about 4-5 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Drain into a fine-mesh strainer.THIS IS THE SECRET: Once you've strained the rice, transfer it to a clean, thin dishtowel.
