A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Combine cake mix, milk, butter, eggs and 2/3 of the container of frosting in a stand mixer or large bowl. Beat with electric mixer on medium for 4 – 5 minutes, or until smooth. Pour batter into a greased Bundt pan and place in oven to bake for 40 – 50 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the cake. Let cake cool completely before inverting on a cake plate. After you have inverted the cake on a plate, place the remaining frosting in a microwave safe bowl and cook k on high in the microwave for 20 seconds. Drizzle warm frosting over bunt cake. Tips: This recipe will work well with any cake and frosting flavor combination. Other flavors you might want to try are: German chocolate cake and German chocolate frosting, carrot cake and cheesecake frosting and butter pecan cake with butter cream frosting.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 350°.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine cake mix, milk, butter, eggs and 2/3 of the container of frosting in a stand mixer or large bowl.
