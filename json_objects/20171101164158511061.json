Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel.

An elegant nose features hints of violet, blackberry and blackcurrants, with subtle aromas of chocolate mint. The wine is robust and strong on the palate, with smooth tannins and distinctive layers of dried plum, dates and cherry flavors that integrate seamlessly with notes of almond and hazelnut, backed up by a long and velvety-smooth finish.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/454160-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gascon-malbec-riserva-2014/162603"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients.
