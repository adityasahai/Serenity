Stir in sugar to dissolve. Sprinkle yeast on top, stir in, and let sit for 5-10 minutes, until foamy. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the microwave, and let it cool to 110-115ºF. Your goal is to have it at this temperature when your yeast mixture is ready. Transfer the yeast mixture to a large bowl and add the butter. Sprinkle 12 3/4 ounces (3 cups, spoon and level) bread flour on top. Add the salt. Mix everything together with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. It should be pretty wet/sticky. Gradually add a bit of the remaining flour** to the dough as needed and mix in until you can work the dough with your hands without it getting stuck everywhere. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead, incorporating more of the remaining flour as necessary, for about 10 minutes.*** When the dough is ready, it should be elastic and tacky, but no so sticky that it gets stuck to the counter or your hands. Shape dough into a smooth ball and place in a greased bowl that is twice its size. Turn once to coat the top of the dough with the cooking spray, and then cover with plastic wrap and leave to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (about 1 hour). Toss the shredded cheese with the minced jalapeño to evenly combine.Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Punch down the risen dough and divide into 9 equal portions (if you have a kitchen scale, use it to make each portion equal in weight). Working with one portion at a time and leaving the rest of the dough covered with plastic wrap, flatten the piece into a round (make sure the center is smooth) and place a scoop of the cheese mixture in the center. Again, if you have a scale, use it to weigh the cheese and jalapeño filling so that you can place an equal amount in each roll. Wrap the filling up inside the dough by lifting the edges of the dough and bringing them together in the center, pinching closed. (Picture tying up a knapsack.) Make sure all of the filling gets sealed in. Turn the roll over and round out the edges with your palms, gently pulling dough towards the bottom of the roll if needed to help smooth out the top.**** Place roll pinch-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. Cover and repeat with remaining rolls, leaving ample space between each roll on the baking sheet. Once all are shaped, cover and leave to rise for 30-40 minutes, until very puffy, like this. Before starting the poaching step, preheat oven to 400ºF with oven racks set in the bottom and top-third positions.Combine water and baking soda in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. One by one, gently dunk each roll into the simmering liquid, top-side up. Poach for about 20 seconds, and then carefully flip with a small strainer and poach for another 20 seconds. Lift up the roll with the strainer, let the excess water drain, and flip roll top-side up onto one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining rolls, dividing between the two baking sheets, leaving a couple inches of space between each roll. The rolls will look wrinkled once they come out of the poaching liquid, but they'll smooth out once they bake. Whisk the egg white with the water for the glaze. Brush glaze all over the exposed areas of the rolls. Sprinkle the top of each roll with some sea salt or pretzel salt. Bake rolls for 18-20 minutes, flipping and rotating baking sheets halfway through the baking time. Tops should be golden when done, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the bottom center of one of the rolls should read about 210ºF. These are best served warm from the oven, but you can also allow them to cool completely on a wire rack and reheat before serving. Rolls can be wrapped in a light kitchen linen and reheated in the microwave, or you can stick the whole batch in a warm oven for a couple minutes to reheat. Any leftover rolls should be kept in a ziploc-type bag.*****","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a microwave safe measuring glass or bowl with at least a 2-cup capacity, microwave the water for 30-40 seconds, until it reads 110-115ºF on an instant-read thermometer.
