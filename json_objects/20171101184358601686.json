Try pairing with Assyrtiko, Moschofilero, and Agiorgitiko. If you feel like going Greek with your Greek food, assyrtiko and moschofilero are both lovely white wines to pair with chicken, seafood, etc. Agiorgitiko is a full bodied red suitable for roasted meats and lamb. The Santo Assyrtiko with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Add the zucchini + mushrooms and toss well, making sure the veggies are completely coated in the seasonings. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Place the potatoes on a large baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, salt + pepper. Gently toss with your hands or two spatulas to evenly coat. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then flip and bake for 15-20 minutes more. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the herbs and toss well. You want the potatoes to be tender, but crisp on the outside.Heat your grill, grill pan or skillet to medium high heat.Transfer the veggies, in batches if needed, to the grill and grill 3-4 minutes per side or until char marks appear. Remove everything from the grill. Alternately you can also roast the veggies at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until soft.To assemble, divide the grilled veggies among warm naan or pita, top with tomatoes, cucumber, olives and avocado. Add the fries and finish with a good sprinkle of feta cheese. Serve with the tzatziki (below)!Sun-Dried Tomato TzatzikiCombine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. If not serving right away, keep covered in the fridge. The tzatziki will keep 2-3 days in the fridge. My avocado stayed pretty green due to the lemon juice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium sized bowl combine the lemon juice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1012028,"name":"smoked paprika","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oregano.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the zucchini + mushrooms and toss well, making sure the veggies are completely coated in the seasonings.","ingredients":[{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spices.png"},{"id":11260,"name":"mushrooms","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Let sit for 10-15 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":425.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Place the potatoes on a large baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, salt + pepper.
