A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Place the bowl over a pot with boiling water inside and whisk the eggs and honey together until creamy and warm. Test with your finger - if they’re warm to the touch, they’re tempered.When the egg and honey mixture is warm to the touch, take the bowl off the heat and mix in coconut, quinoa and salt.Chill in the fridge for at least two hours.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with a non-stick baking mat or double parchment paper (the bottoms are sensitive and will burn easily).Using an ice cream scoop or two spoons, scoop the coconut quinoa dough onto the baking sheet. You will probably need to form the cookies into little round half domes with your fingers, pressing them together tightly so they are sure to stick together while baking.Bake in the center of a warm oven for 15 minutes until the cookies are nice and golden brown.Let them cool for at least 10 minutes or until completely cooled.
