Try pairing with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

Stir occasionally, adding a little water, if needed, to prevent burning until onions are softened and golden. Add the chard a little at a time, constantly turning with tongs until all of the chard is wilted. (You may have to do this in batches.) Transfer to a bowl, set aside and keep warm. Do not rinse pan as it will be used for the vinaigrette.For Polenta Croutons: While onion is cooking, heat the 2 tsp. olive oil in a non-stick pan. Add the polenta rounds and let brown on each side for about 5 minutes each. (This might need to be done in two batches. Also, be careful of splattering oil. Use a mesh splatter screen.) Remove from pan and place on a plate. Keep warm until ready to assemble salad.For Warm Cherry Tomato Vinaigrette: After the chard has been transferred to a bowl, add the garlic, white balsamic vinegar, agave and mustard to the pan. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any brown bits of onion in the pan. Let cook on low heat until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the olive oil and whisk to combine. Add the halved cherry tomatoes, thyme sprigs, and another sprinkle of salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary. (If the tomatoes are really acidic, you can add more agave. If it's too sweet, add a little more vinegar.)To serve: Transfer the chard to a large serving platter. Arrange the polenta rounds on top, followed by the warm cherry tomato vinaigrette. Sprinkle the toasted pine nuts and thymes leaves over the top. Serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For Wilted Chard: In a large, 12\" skillet, heat the olive oil and add the onion.
