A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Special equipment: lollipop sticks              Use a small cookie scoop or a rounded tablespoon to make balls out of the leftover cheesecake. After you scoop out the balls, roll them in your hands to make the rounds neater. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and insert a lollipop stick in the top of each. Squeeze the cheesecake around the base of each lollipop stick to ensure it will stay put. Pop into the freezer for 1 full hour.                          Set up a double boiler by bringing a medium saucepan of water to a simmer. Place a small bowl over the top, making sure the bottom doesn't touch the water. Add the candy melts to the bowl and stir until smooth and melted. Stir in the vegetable oil until smooth.                          Quickly dip the cheesecake balls into the melted chocolate and twirl to coat. You may need a knife to help cover the balls. Sprinkle the cheesecake balls before the chocolate dries with your choice of chopped candy, peanuts or toffee brickle and place back on the baking sheet. Refrigerate to set up, about 5 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: lollipop sticks","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Use a small cookie scoop or a rounded tablespoon to make balls out of the leftover cheesecake.
