Lay thebutter slices out over the middle of thedough, in a rectangle. Fold the pastryover the top, bottom and then sidesuntil the butter is completely hidden.Press the edges down.Roll the dough out to a 50 x 30cmrectangle, first tapping out the doughwith the rolling pin in gentle ridges, sothat you can tell the butter is beingsquashed out evenly inside the pastry,before rolling properly. Turn dough 90degrees, then fold the right third overand the left third over that. Do this threetimes, chilling for 15 mins after each roll.Cut the dough in half, into 2 squares.Roll one piece of dough to 35 x 35cm.Cut into 9 squares, then follow theinstructions below for each fillingand shape.
