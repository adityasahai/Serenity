Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too.

Remove from water and let rest until cool enough to handle.  Peel the skin off the tongue, trim the gristle, and cut into bite-size pieces.                            While the tongue is cooling, combine tomatoes, onion and cilantro in a medium bowl.  Mix well and set aside.                            In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Cook tongue with salt and pepper until heated through and slightly colored, 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain.                            In a small skillet, heat tortillas 1 minute on each side.  To assemble tacos, layer tongue and tomato mixture inside a folded tortilla and sprinkle with lemon juice.  Serve immediately.
