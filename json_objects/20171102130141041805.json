Butter an 8\" square baking dish. Whisk together the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add melted butter and stir in until the crumbly mixture is evenly moist. Use a large, flat spatula to firmly press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, creating a flat, compact base layer. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes while you make the molasses filling. Keep the oven at 350° F in preparation for baking the bars with the filling. In the same large bowl as previously used, whisk together the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Whisk until smooth. Whisk in the molasses, vanilla, cinnamon, and ginger until smooth. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and fold into the mixture until just combined and smooth. Pour the molasses batter over the slightly cooled graham cracker crust in an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the very center of the bars comes out looking clean.**Allow the bars to cool, and then dust with powdered sugar, slice, and serve. These bars are phenomenal the first day they're baked, but to keep them tasting their best in the following days, I recommend storing them in an airtight container, at room temperature if possible.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350° F.
