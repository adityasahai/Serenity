This rich 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is made from the oldest estate vineyards,planted back in 1975 on soils rich in chalk, clay and pebbles. Harvested by hand in the second partof October, the grapes are gently pressed and macerated with the skins for 1012days to ensureideal color concentration and structure. After full malolactic fermentation in barrels, the wine ismatured for one more year in the same French barriques and then refined in bottle for another eightmonths.Valle Reale introduces the wine lover to a new breed of Montepulciano. Surprisingly concentrated,with silky tannins and layers of dark berry fruit and spices, this is a rich and aromatic Montepulcianod'Abruzzo. Fullbodiedand firm, yet supple, it is ready to be enjoyed with hearty pasta dishes,roasted poultry or lamb, and ribs.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447010-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/valle-reale-vigneto-di-popoli-montepulciano-dabruzzo-2006/104761"}]},"instructions":"Melt the butter over medium high heat.
