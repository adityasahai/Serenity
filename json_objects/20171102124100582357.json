Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.    Whisk together the oats, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and freshly grated nutmeg and keep at hand.    Working in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or using a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar on medium speed until smooth and creamy.    Add the eggs one at a time and beat for 1 minute after each addition and then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients slowly, beating only until blended.    Add the dried cranberries or raisins and mix to incorporate them evenly into the dough. (At this point, the dough can be wrapped well and chilled for up to 2 days.)    Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the baking sheets or use a medium (1 1/2 tablespoons) scoop. If the dough has been chilled, gently press down on the mounds of dough until they’re about 1/2-inch thick.    Slide the sheets into the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, rotating the sheets front to back and top to bottom after 7 minutes. The cookies will be golden and just firm around the edges.    Lift the cookies onto cooling racks with a wide metal spatula – they’ll firm as they cool. Repeat with the remaining dough always making certain that your baking sheets are cool.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Getting ready: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
