White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"1 Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook a minute more.  Add the chopped mango, ginger, raisins, mustard seeds, red pepper flakes, vinegar, water, and sugar.  Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and let cook gently for 30 minutes.2 While the chutney is cooking, cook the chicken.  Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in the middle position. Coat the bottom of a roasting pan with olive oil.  Rinse the chicken thighs in water, pat dry. Rub some olive oil all over the chicken pieces, sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place chicken pieces in roasting pan. Cook in oven until the juices run clear when poked with a sharp knife, or when the internal temperature of the thighs is 180°F, about 30 minutes.  If the chicken pieces are not browned enough for you, you can finish them in the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  If your chicken pieces are extra large, after 30 minutes, lower the heat to 350°F and cook until the chicken pieces are cooked through.  Remove chicken and roasting pan from oven.3 Remove chicken pieces from roasting pan.  Pour off rendered chicken fat, save for a teaspoon or so. (Do not pour down the drain or it will solidify and block your drain).  Put mango sauce into the roasting pan with remaining chicken drippings.  Spread the sauce over the whole bottom of the pan.  Let sit for a few minutes to soften the drippings, then scoop up and place into a serving dish.  Adjust seasonings. If too acidic, add more sugar. Add salt to taste.Serve chicken with mango chutney sauce and steamed rice or Spanish rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the garlic and cook a minute more.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the chopped mango, ginger, raisins, mustard seeds, red pepper flakes, vinegar, water, and sugar.
