White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon.
