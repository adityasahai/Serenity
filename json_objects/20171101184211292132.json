A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry.

Line the bottom of an 8-inch cake pan with parchment paper and spray it with olive oil spray or other gluten free cooking oil spray.Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl on high speed until they reach stiff peaks; and set aside.Addhot, melted shortening into the bowl of your mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the brown sugar, cocoa powder and hot milk. Beat on medium speeduntil smooth.Add applesauce and beat until thoroughly.In a separate bowl whisktogether the flour blend, coconut flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; and add to the mixing bowl a little at a time while beating on medium speed.Add vanilla and mix on low speed until distributed.Using a silicone or rubber spatula, fold in one-third of the beaten egg whites until each disapears into the batter. (Always start in the center of the bowl, folding down and up towards you. Rotate the bowl as you fold.)Pour the batter into the prepared pan and distribute the batter evenly.Bake for about 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. (If the cake begins to crack on top, remove it from the oven, this is not an indication that it is done or dry.)Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes. Then place the rack on top of the pan and invert it removing the pan. Allow the cake to cool on the rack. Once the cake reaches room temperature, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill it. (This prevents tons of crumbs from forming when you frost it.)Make your desired frosting. (My husband enjoys this cake with mint extract in the frosting.) Spread the frosting on top of the cake. If using coconut flakes, immediately sprinkle and pat them into the edges of the frosting before it sets. Top with your favorite fruit. Slice and serve. To freeze leftovers, slice the cake into individual servings, place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze solid. Once frozen, place in individual ziplock bags.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325F.
