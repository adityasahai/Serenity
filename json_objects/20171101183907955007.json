Line two large baking sheets with double layers of foil. Combine the salt, dry mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl. Divide the ribs between baking sheets and sprinkle evenly with spice mixture. Wrap each rib individually with foil.Bake the ribs until very tender but not falling apart, about 2 hours. Let the ribs cool completely. Rewrap the ribs in foil and place in the refrigerator until chilled or up to 3 days (chilling the ribs makes them easier to grill without falling apart and the flavor actually develops the longer they're in the fridge).Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Grill the ribs, basting with the barbecue sauce mixture and turning frequently, until lacquered and charred in places and heated through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; cut between ribs to separate. Transfer to a platter and serve with additional barbecue sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°.
