After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 58 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435309,"title":"Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot","description":"This wine shows aromas of sweet plum sauce, vanilla, chocolate, cedar and butterscotch with big, forward black cherry and black berry fruit in the mouth. A balanced middle with a hint of toasty oak is paired with a nice bite from rounded tannins, and a long pleasant finish. This wine pairs well with grilled meats and wild game with herb-infused, wild-berry sauces, hearty pasta dishes and Pacific Northwest Salmon.","price":"$57.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435309-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/duckhorn-napa-valley-merlot-1995/26649"}]},"instructions":"Turn your grill on to high heat.In a saucepan, bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil.

Once syrupy, turn the heat to low and leave it on the stove.Generously salt and pepper both sides of each steak.Add the steaks to the grill and cook for 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add the goat cheese for the last minute of grill time, so that it melts slightly. (The times will depend on the size of your steaks and how well done you like them. I followthis grilling guide.)Remove from the grill and let rest for about 3 minutes before serving.Drizzle each steak with balsamic reduction.
