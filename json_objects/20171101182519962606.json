Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Add the brown and granulated sugar and whisk until no lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and pumpkin puree.In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until no white remains. The dough will be very soft. Stir in the white chocolate chips.Refrigerate the dough for at least one hour or overnight. If you refrigerate more than 3 hours, you'll need to take the bowl out and allow the dough to warm up for 10-15 minutes before scooping.When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. *Note: I recommend starting with one test cookie before baking the entire batch. Scoop the dough by the rounded Tablespoon onto the baking sheet, spacing them an inch apart. Just barely press a pretzel into the top of each one. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges are set and center is still puffy and underbaked. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to set up on the baking pan for 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and cool completely.Store cookies in an airtight container. Cookies will stay soft for at least five days, but the pretzels will get soggy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium sized, microwave safe bowl, melt the butter.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/microwave.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the brown and granulated sugar and whisk until no lumps remain.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Whisk in the vanilla and pumpkin puree.In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until no white remains.
