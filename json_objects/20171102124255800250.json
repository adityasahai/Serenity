Place a pizza stone on the rack if you like. Heat oven to 500 or more degrees F.Heat olive oil in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic and cook swirling the pan often until garlic is sizzling and just beginning to color, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and set garlic aside to cool while still in the oil.Divide dough into 16 ping-pong (or slightly smaller) sized balls. Flatten or roll each ball into a thin disc about 3 ½-inches in diameter. Lay them onto a parchment-lined baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal. Don’t crowd them, you may need to use two baking sheets. Let rest at room temperature at least 20 minutes before proceeding.If dough discs have retracted after they have rested use your fingertips to return them to about 3 ½-inches in diameter. Brush each one with a little of the cooled garlic & olive oil mixture, getting plenty of crunchy garlic bits onto each disc. Divide mozzarella evenly on top of each; followed by minced rosemary and Parmesan cheese.Garnish with 2 or 3 slices of garlic, a tiny sprig of rosemary and a small drizzle of olive oil per pizzette,Bake pizzettes in the very hot oven 6 to 8 minutes, or until crusts are golden and crisp with cheese getting slightly charred. Watch them carefully as they can go from charred to burnt quickly. Serve hot.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place oven rack in top position.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place a pizza stone on the rack if you like.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":406907,"name":"pizza stone","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pizza-stone.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat oven to 500 or more degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Heat olive oil in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add minced garlic and cook swirling the pan often until garlic is sizzling and just beginning to color, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Remove pan from heat and set garlic aside to cool while still in the oil.Divide dough into 16 ping-pong (or slightly smaller) sized balls.
