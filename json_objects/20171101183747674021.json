Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436659,"title":"Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"The aromas of this complex red wine range from cherries and plums to gladiolus flowers and earthy flint. The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish. Recommended for barbecued meat, like sliced Chianina steak, or with game, such as pheasant stuffed with truffles. It is also excellent with mature cheese.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436659-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/santa-margherita-chianti-classico-riserva-2013/167314"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
