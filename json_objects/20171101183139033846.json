Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Gascon Malbec with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437536,"title":"Gascon Malbec","description":"A classic expression of the grape, our Don Miguel Gasc√≥n Malbec opens with intense aromas of blackberry, plum and a hint of mocha. On the palate, dark fruit flavors are finely intertwined with notes of spice, licorice and chocolate for a magnificent full-bodied Malbec.
