Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

In a mixing bowl, beat room temperature butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until creamed together. In a separate bowl, mix flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt with a fork.Add flour/cocoa/baking soda/salt mixture a little at a time into butter/sugar/eggs/vanilla mixture by beating at low speed until well blended.Using a teaspoon, scoop out balls of batter and shape with your fingers around ½ caramel square. This part might be a little messy!Drop the balls of dough onto cookie sheets, leaving an inch around each cookie drop.If oven is still preheating, let chill in refrigerator for a few minutes (I find this helps the cookies keep their shape).Place into oven and bake for 8-10 minutes. Do not over-bake or cookies will be hard. Let cool 2 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.Melt extra caramel in microwave, 10 seconds at a time until melted, then transfer to a ziplock bag with a hole cut in the corner and drizzle over the cookies.Sprinkle with sea salt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350° F (175° C).
