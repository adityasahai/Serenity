Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"1. Soak rice sticks in large bowl of hot water 8 minutes. Drain well.  2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tsp. oil in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs in small bowl with 2 tsp. water and white pepper, and season with salt, if desired. Pour eggs into skillet, and swirl pan so eggs cover bottom in even layer. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, then carefully flip omelet. Cook 1 minute more, then transfer to cutting board, and slice into strips.  3. Heat remaining 1 tsp. oil in skillet; add asparagus and snow peas. Stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes, add garlic, and cook 1 minute more. Whisk together broth, soy sauce, and sriracha in bowl. Add mixture to pan; bring to a simmer. Stir in rice sticks, and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Mix in egg strips and green onions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Soak rice sticks in large bowl of hot water 8 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain well.  2.
