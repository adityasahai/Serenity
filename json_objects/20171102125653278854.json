Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. The Gascon Malbec with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437536,"title":"Gascon Malbec","description":"A classic expression of the grape, our Don Miguel Gascón Malbec opens with intense aromas of blackberry, plum and a hint of mocha. On the palate, dark fruit flavors are finely intertwined with notes of spice, licorice and chocolate for a magnificent full-bodied Malbec. Round tannins and a plush mouthfeel lead the way to a long, velvety finish.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437536-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gascon-malbec-2012/128058"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the molasses, mustard and vinegar; add pork.
