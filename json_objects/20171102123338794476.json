Some recommended food pairings are crab cakes, Gorgonzola cheese, Ch√®vre, figs and chocolate, or a good cigar.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430931-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2001-St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Zinfandel/dp/B00EGF5XWU"}]},"instructions":"In a medium mixing bowl, use a hand mixer on low speed to combine the milk and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, approximately 1-2 minutes.Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla.
