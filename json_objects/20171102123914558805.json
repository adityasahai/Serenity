Line a baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper. Bring water to a light simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in tapioca flour and continue stirring until it creates a sticky ball (you’ll think something has gone terribly wrong at this point, but don’t worry!). Spoon the mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Add the coconut flour, sea salt and butter to the bowl. Process for about 20 seconds and then while the processor is on, add the two eggs and continue to process for 1 minute. Add cheese and process for another 30 seconds until the mixture is smooth. Let the dough sit for 5 minutes.Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup, scoop dough and place onto the lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, leaving at least 2 inches inbetween each bun. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if using. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until just turning golden brown. Cool completely. Cut each bun in half and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375ºF and adjust rack to middle position.
