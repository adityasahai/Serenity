Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. One wine you could try is Bellissima Sparkling rosé. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Brush potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour or until a fork can be inserted to the potatoes easily.    Once potatoes are cool enough to touch, cut in half and carefully remove the flesh. Try not to break the skins. I'd recommend saving the flesh for baked potato soup.    Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees. Spray a cooling rack with cooking spray. Place the potato skins, skin side up on the cooling rack. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until skins are crispy.    Remove potato skins from oven. Divide shredded cheese evenly between the potato skins. Sprinkle with green onions. Bake for 5 more minutes or until the cheese is melted. You can also place them under the broiler for 2 - 3 minutes to get the cheese hot and bubbly.    In a bowl mix the sour cream, horseradish and Worcestershire sauce. Place a dollop on top of each potato skin. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Brush potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour or until a fork can be inserted to the potatoes easily.
