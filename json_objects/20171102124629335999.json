Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

In another mixing bowl, stir together butter vanilla, both sugars and egg. Stir until well combined. Add the wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until combined. The dough will be sticky.Add chocolate chips and dried cranberries and mix in well. Cover the bowl with saran wrap and place in fridge for at least 2 hours to overnight. When ready to bake, line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Scoop the dough with medium size cookie scoop (1 and 1/2 Tablespoon size). Place scoops of dough on prepared baking sheet, spacing them 2\" apart. Add few chocolate chips on each scoop, if desired. Bake cookies for 13 to 15 minutes. For me 14 minutes was the magic number. Let cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer onto cooling rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (oats, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves (if using), salt.
