A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Add the buttermilk and egg, and stir together into a dough. Do not over mix, and you may decide to ditch the spoon and just use your hands.Pour the dough out onto a well floured surface, and pat it out to about 1 inch thick. Fold it into thirds (like a letter) and pat it out to 1 inch thick again. This will help your biscuits rise up to be nice and flakey.Cut the biscuits out with a 2 inch round cutter place them on a baking sheet. Sprinkle the top generously with sparkling sugar.Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.Allow to cool.Add sugar to the sliced peaches and let them sit while you make your biscuits. They will become soft and juicy. Or you can just omit the sugar for a less juicy filling.In the bowl of an electric mixer (I use a chilled metal bowl) combine heavy cream, sugar and vanilla extract and whip on low speed for 1-2 minutes. Then increase the speed and whip until soft peaks form.Slice each biscuit in half and arrange a layer of peaches. Spoon the whipped cream into a plastic bag with one corner cut and pipe the cream on top of the peaches. Add raspberries, and then another layer of whipped cream. Top with the biscuit, and decorate with a bit of whipped cream and a single raspberry.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.Grate butter into the bowl (or cut into small cubes) and freeze for 5 minutes.In a small bowl, mix buttermilk and egg together.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the bowl from the freezer, and cut the butter into the flour mixture until you have coarse crumbs.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the buttermilk and egg, and stir together into a dough.
