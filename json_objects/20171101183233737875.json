A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line 9 muffin cups with paper liners. Place the almonds in the bowl of a food processor. Process just until fine crumbs form. Add the prunes, salt, baking soda, coconut oil, and vanilla and process again until the mixture forms a crumbly paste.Divide the mixture evenly among cupcake liners (about 2 tablespoons each) and press firmly into the bottom of the liners. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges brown. Allow to cool completely.Drain the cashews and place in a food processor or high-powered blender. Start to blend until the cashews turn to crumbs and then a paste. Add the agave, lemon zest, lemon juice, and coconut oil and continue to blend, stopping to scrape down the sides often, until the puree is creamy and no more bits of nuts remain. Once the mixture is very creamy, add the vanilla and salt and add half of the blueberries and blend until smooth. Add remaining berries and blend again until creamy, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed.Pour the blueberry mixture on top of each crust, filling to the top of the liner (you may have some extra filling - simply set it aside in the fridge for a bowl of crust-less cheesecake.) Place in the freezer for 4 hours or until firm. You can freeze overnight or even for more than a day; if you do, place in refrigerator several hours before serving to thaw.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325ºF.
