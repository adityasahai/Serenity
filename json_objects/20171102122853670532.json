Gradually add water, a few tablespoons at a time, working dough in between each addition. Dough is done when it comes together and feels smooth but not sticky. You probably won’t use all of the water – I use about 3/4 cup each time.Wrap dough in plastic and chill in the fridge for at least thirty minutes while you prepare the filling.When it’s time to form the pierogis, remove dough from fridge and roll it out approx. 1/2 cup at a time (to prevent overworking it) on a floured surface until it is about 1/8? thick.Cut dough into circles with a cookie cutter or a glass turned upside down. I usually make my dough circles about 2.5? in diameter.Put about 1/2 tsp. of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the top of the circle over the filling and pinch the ends together with your fingertips to seal the pierogi. I like to start pinching the dough together in the center of the pierogi and working my way to the edges – this gives me more control over the edge and lets me make it kind of a scalloped finish (like in the pictures). It takes some practice – don’t give up!Cook pierogis in boiling water for 4 minutes and then transfer to a SUPER hot skillet with a tiny bit of butter. Fry for about 2 minutes on each side or until they develop a nice, brown, crispy crust.Top with Sour Cream and Chive sauce. (YUMM-O).Slice the potatoes into quarters and put in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Cook potatoes for about 30 minutes or until they can be easily mashed with a fork or spoon.Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the pot to the stove.Heat olive oil in the pot. Add garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and thyme and saute until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.Return the potatoes to the pot with the garlic/thyme/onion mixture. Add milk to the pot and mash with a potato masher.Add fontina and parmesan cheeses to potato mixture. Stir the cheese into the potatoes with a spoon or spatula until cheese is melted and potatoes are smooth. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before you form the pierogis (I usually make the potatoes the day before and keep them in the fridge overnight – makes for less work the next day!)When it’s time to form the pierogis, remove dough from fridge and roll it out approx. 1/2 cup at a time (to prevent overworking it) on a floured surface until it is about 1/8? thick.Cut dough into circles with a cookie cutter or a glass turned upside down.

Be careful not to overcrowd the pot or the skillet – pierogis should have enough room to cook while still being in a single layer so they don’t stick to each other or cook at different speeds.Top with Sour Cream and Chive sauce.
