A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Place the racks in the center position. Line cupcake tins with cupcake liners. Set aside.In a large bowl combine both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.In a medium bowl whisk together the milk, sour cream, and egg whites. Set aside. In a small food chopper, blend the zest and the sugar together until the zest is very fine. Set aside.Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, or use a hand mixer (I achieve a better dome with the hand mixer). Add the butter, sugar and vanilla to the bowl and beat at medium speed for 3 minutes, or until light. Scrape the sides as necessary.Add the vanilla extract and one third of the flour mixture while beating on medium speed, again scraping the sides as needed. Beat in half of the sour cream mixture. Alternately add the remaining flour mixture and sour cream until all the wet and dry ingredients have added, beating until the batter fully incorporated and smooth.Use a large scoop (about 3 tablespoons), evenly divide the batter between 18 lined muffin tins filling each about 2/3 of the way full.Bake for 15-24 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers come out clean. Cool on wire rack.For the Buttercream:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the butter. Beat until fluffy. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly add the confectioners' sugar while continuing to beat.Once well blended, add in the vanilla, lime juice, and 4 tablespoons of strawberry puree. Mix on low speed until well combined and moist. If desired, an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of strawberry puree until your desired consistency is reached. Beat at high speed until frosting is smooth and fluffy.Pipe or decorate as desired.
