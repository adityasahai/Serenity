Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":459422,"title":"Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia","description":"Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia is certainly the most representative wine of Cecchi. Produced only in years in which the grapes reach the quality desired it comes from the area of Castellina in Chianti. The color of excellent limpidity is of an intense ruby red.

Stir fry over a medium heat for around 5 minutes, until the onion is soft and the broccoli is just tender.Remove the vegetables from the pan, and set aside.Add the rice to the pan (no need to clean the pan), and after a minute or so, begin to add the hot stock a couple of ladlefuls at a time. Stirring regularly, cook the rice over a medium heat until most of the stock has been absorbed, and then add another couple of ladlefuls. Continue doing this until the rice is cooked.While the rice is cooking, prepare your quick parsley pesto. Add the pine nuts to a mini food processor, and blitz to form a coarse crumb. Add the parsley and olive oil, and blitz again to create your pesto.When the rice is just about cooked, return your vegetables to the pan, and add the parsley pesto (retain a little for drizzling over the top if desired). Season generously with black pepper.When the vegetables have been reheated thoroughly, serve the risotto topped with any remaining pesto, a few extra pine nuts (if you have any), and a drizzle of olive oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oil in a large pan or wok, and add all of the vegetables (onion to broccoli).
