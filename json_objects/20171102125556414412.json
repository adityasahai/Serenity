Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. You could try Poet's Leap Riesling. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445345,"title":"Poet's Leap Riesling","description":"Key lime and fresh citrus peel aromas give way to vivid layers of white peach and stone fruit flavors accented by a pleasant touch of minerality.

Place bread crumbs into a shallow dish; pour eggs into a separate shallow dish. Heat vegetable shortening in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dip pork chops into egg, then into bread crumbs, coating both sides. Fry chops in the hot shortening until crumbs are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
