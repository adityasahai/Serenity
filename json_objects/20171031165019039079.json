Now, lay a dough circle on top of the filling in each jar, and use your fingers or a fork to tease the edges of the crusts gently together. Cut a few small slashes in the top of each pie to allow the steam to vent. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours. (At this point, the unbaked pies can be covered with a lid and frozen for up to 2 months.)                                                                                                                             10                                                                            Preheat the oven to 375\xb0F. Just before baking, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon water until blended. Brush the top crust of each pie with the egg mixture.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Arrange the jars on a rimmed baking sheet, place in the oven, and bake until the top and side crusts are golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a baking rack for at least 1 hour before serving.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            Once the pies have cooled for 1 hour, they can be popped out of the jars. Holding a jar in your nondominant hand, run a sharp, thin knife around the inside rim of the jar with your other hand to loosen any filling that may have stuck to the glass. Then gently invert the pie into your palm. It should slide from the jar with little resistance. If it sticks, coax it out gently by running the knife along the inside edge of the jar. Once the pie slides free of the jar, quickly invert it onto a plate or the baking rack.
