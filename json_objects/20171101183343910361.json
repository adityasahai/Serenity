Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Prepare pasta as directed.While pasta is cooking, process garlic cloves in food processor until finely chopped.Add arugula (two large handfuls), lemon zest and juice, nuts, oil, parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.Process until desired consistency.Toss with pasta and top with shredded parmesan and red pepper flakes if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare pasta as directed.While pasta is cooking, process garlic cloves in food processor until finely chopped.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"whole garlic cloves","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add arugula (two large handfuls), lemon zest and juice, nuts, oil, parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.Process until desired consistency.Toss with pasta and top with shredded parmesan and red pepper flakes if desired.","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg"},{"id":11959,"name":"arugula","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
