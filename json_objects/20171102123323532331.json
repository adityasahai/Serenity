Drizzle in butter. Stir just to combine but do not fully incorporate. Texture should be crumbly with some large clumps.</p><p>                Transfer 1 1/4 cups (loosely packed) crust mixture to a medium bowl; add cinnamon and remaining 3 Tbsp. sugar. Knead with fingertips until well-combined but still crumbly with a few pea-sized pieces remaining. Freeze until ready to use.</p><p>                Add vinegar and 2 Tbsp. cold water to remaining crust mixture. Stir to form a dough, then transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until the texture is smooth. Transfer to pie pan and press into bottom and up sides with a flat-bottomed measuring cup. Crimp edge with a floured fork, if desired, and freeze while you prepare the filling.</p><p>                Make the filling and bake the pie:</p><p>                Position 1 rack in bottom third and 1 rack in center of oven; preheat to 425F. Place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack to preheat.</p><p>                Slice peaches into 1/4-inch-thick wedges, then transfer to a large bowl.
