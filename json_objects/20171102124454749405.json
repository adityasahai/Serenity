After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425 F.Prepare The Potatoes: Peel potatoes and cut a tiny slice cut off at each end, to flatten. Slice potatoes crosswise into -inch thick pieces (4-5 slices per potato) Count the number of potato slices to determine how many slices of steak youll need (*see below)In a small bowl, combine garlic powder, onion powder, paprika,  teaspoon salt, and  teaspoon pepper. Place potato slices in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle on spice mix and toss. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on parchment-lined pan. Bake for 20 minutes, until tender. Remove from the oven and tent with foil.Prepare The Beef: Before slicing the tenderloin, determine how many pieces you need. *There are two pieces of steak and 3 slices of potato in each stack. (For example: 8 stacks require 24 slices of potato and 16 pieces of steak) The steak should be about the same thickness as the potatoes so I suggest starting by using a very sharp knife to slice the tenderloin horizontally into  inch thick slices. Then cut it into however many smaller pieces you need.Sprinkle meat with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. In a large cast iron skillet or non-stick pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add half the steak pieces. Cook for 1  - 2 minutes per side for medium rare. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining steak.Make The Stacks: Assemble the stacks on a serving platter with the largest pieces of potato on the bottom. Place the largest pieces of steak on top, then the medium sized pieces of potato, then the rest of the steak, and top with the smallest pieces of potato. Drizzle each stack with  teaspoon of truffle oil, and top with a generous pinch of tarragon. Serve warm or at room temperature.Make Ahead: Stacks can be assembled on a parchment-lined baking pan up to 3 hours ahead and kept covered with plastic wrap in the fridge. Bring to room temperature and then heat in a 400 F oven for 5-10 minutes just before serving. Transfer to a platter or individual plates, finish with truffle oil and tarragon, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425 F.Prepare The Potatoes: Peel potatoes and cut a tiny slice cut off at each end, to flatten.
