Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"1.
