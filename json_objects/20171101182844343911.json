with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate.

Lay thighs side-by-side and and trim each one into uniform, trapezoid shapes, removing excess fat. Turn thighs over and cut away muscle along the back of the thigh bone.                                                                                                                             3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Using a paring knife, carefully scrape excess fat from chicken skins. Trim skins so they’re slightly smaller than the thighs (the skin should wrap around the thigh, fully covering the front and about half of the back). Reattach skins by threading toothpicks on both sides of bottom of the thigh, securing meat and skin together. Refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Using a marinade injector, inject 1/2 ounce of chicken stock into left and right side of thigh meat. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle back of each thigh with 1/2 tablespoon of White BBQ Rub and let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Fire up smoker or grill to 250°F, adding chunks of smoking wood chunks when at temperature. Place 6 tablespoons of margarine in each pan. Rest one chicken thigh on top of each piece of margarine, skin-side up. Sprinkle tops of thighs with 1/2 tablespoon of White BBQ Rub. Place in smoker and smoke for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cover each pan with aluminum foil and continue to cook for 1 hour more.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In a medium saucepan, combine barbecue sauce and grape juice.
