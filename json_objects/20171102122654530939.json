Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Banfi Rosa Regale Brachetto ( half-bottle) with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448167,"title":"Banfi Rosa Regale Brachetto ( half-bottle)","description":"This sparkling red wine made from Brachetto d'Acqui in Piedmont, Italy is love at first sip and a perpetual crowd pleaser. The color is a festive cranberry. Aromatic with hints of raspberries, strawberries and rose petals. There is a taste of fresh raspberries, with crisp acidity, enticing the palate with an initial softness, graduating to a clean and dry finish. Perfect for any occasion. A unique and festive sparkling wine, seductive aperitif, and elegant dessert wine. Pairs well with seafood, cheeses, spicy fare and chocolate. Serve chilled.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448167-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/banfi-rosa-regale-brachetto-375ml-half-bottle-2012/130015"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.In an oven-safe skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
