White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil, then place the chicken breasts on the pan, skin side up. Drizzle liberally with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until fully cooked and the center registers 165 degrees F. Remove to a plate until cool enough to handle. Remove the skin and cut into thick slices. Set aside.Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, then set an oven-proof wire rack on the same baking sheet you used for the chicken (no need to wash it). Lightly coat the wire rack with cooking spray, then arrange the bacon in a single layer on top of the rack. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, until crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and pat dry.While the oven is still hot, slice the bread in half horizontally, and place it, cut sides up, on a clean baking sheet or directly on the rack. Place in the oven until lightly toasted, about 5 to 7 minutes.Assemble the sandwiches: Spread the cut sides of both slices of bread liberally with the Caesar dressing. Arrange half of the spinach on the bottom slices of bread, then layer as follows: sun-dried tomatoes, shaved Parmesan, cooked bacon, and sliced chicken. Sprinkle with a little extra black pepper and then top with the remaining spinach. Lay the second slice of toasted bread on top. Slice and serve at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
