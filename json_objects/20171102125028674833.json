Using a mixer cream together room temperature butter and powdered sugar for about 2 minutes or until the butter and sugar are light and creamy.  Add in 2 cups of flour and beat gently until flour is incorporated to the creamed sugar.   Add in vanilla and mix until just blended. When the dough has turned into a soft uniform ball turn dough onto a lightly floured board.Roll dough into a rectangle shape.  Cut the dough into 4 even verticals and then cut them horizontally in about 1/2 inch stripes.  Use a fork to prick the cookies about three or four times a cookie so they will bake evenly.   Place cookies onto an un-greased cookie sheet leaving a small distance between each cookie.  Refrigerate cookies on the cookie sheet for about 15 minutes before baking the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes.  By refrigerating the dough you will keep them from spreading out too much.Melt caramel bits in the microwave for about 45 seconds, or until melted.   Spread a thin layer of caramel over the baked cookies.Over a double boiler melt together 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of coconut oil   Stir continually until the chocolate has melted.
