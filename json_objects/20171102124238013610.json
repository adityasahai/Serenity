Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Use your mixer on medium-high speed to beat ingredients for 2-3 minutes until fluffy and combined. Add egg yolks and vanilla and continue to beat until those are mixed in. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the reserved flour mixture a little at a time until just combined.  Turn off mixer and fold pistachio nuts into cookie dough (I used my hands to do this because the dough is thick and I found it easier).Divide the dough into two equal halves. Place each half on a separate piece of parchment paper and form the dough into a log shape, about 2” thick in diameter. Roll each log up tightly in the parchment paper and refrigerate them for a minimum of two hours (though you may chill them for up to 2-3 days if need be).When ready to bake, pre-heat the oven to 350 and line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap the dough and use a serrated knife to slice each log into 30 equal rounds. Place the rounds an inch apart on the baking sheets and sprinkle them with the white sugar.Bake the cookies (in batches if need be) for 11-13 minutes until edges are set. Once cookies are cool enough to move, transfer them to a wire rack for cooling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt and stir together to combine and set aside.In the bowl of your electric mixer, combine the butter, yogurt and brown sugar.
