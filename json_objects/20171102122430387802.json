A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Grease the pan lightly with non-stick cooking spray and line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper. Sift the barley flour and stir together rest of the dry ingredients (sugar to cocoa powder) and create a well in the center. To the well add all the wet ingredients one by one.  Mix until just combined.  Don’t over mix.  It’s OK to have some lumps. Pour the batter in the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.  Mine was done by 27 minutes.  If baking cupcakes, check around 13-15th minute. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let it cool for 15 minutes.  Remove the parchment paper on the sides of the pan and slowly invert the pan on a plate and the cake comes out perfect without sticking to the pan. Cool completely before frosting.</p>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven at 350F/180C for 15 minutes.
