White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Toss potatoes with oil and seasonings in a large bowl then spread out onto one of the prepared baking sheets and roast for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, combine feta and green onions together in a small bowl then set aside. Mix hummus with buffalo wing sauce and cayenne pepper in another small bowl then set aside. Cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast then place on secondprepared baking sheet. Stuff each pocket with a quarter of the feta/green onion mixture then press down firmly on top to make sure chicken breasts are as flat as possible. Pat the chicken dry, season the tops liberally with salt and pepper, and then spread the buffalo hummusall over the chicken (if you spread it on too thick it will melt off in the oven.) Sprinkle each chicken breast with a quarter of the pulverized rice chex or panko bread crumbs, sprinkle smoked paprika on top, and then mist or spray tops with extra virgin olive oil or nonstick spray.Place chicken into the oven after the potatoes have been roasting for 15 minutes then roast the chicken and potatoes together for 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown and chicken is cooked through (potatoes will roast for 30 minutes total.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees then line two baking sheets with foil, spray with nonstick spray, and then set aside.
