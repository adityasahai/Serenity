Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Coat the chicken on both sides with the mustard rub. Season both sides of the chicken with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.In a measuring cup, combine remaining lemon zest (2 teaspoons), lemon juice, and the chicken broth. Set aside.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large OVEN-SAFE skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the chicken into the hot oil and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until it has turned golden brown.  Flip the chicken then add the minced garlic to the pan and cook, stirring constantly for 30 seconds. Add the lemon juice mixture and stir, making sure to scrape any of the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Place the pan into the oven and bake 20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.Remove pan from the oven then transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with an aluminum foil tent. Place the pan over medium heat and bring the liquid to a gentle boil.In a small bowl, use your fingers to mix the butter and flour together, making a dry, crumbly paste. Whisk the flour and butter into the sauce. The sauce will thicken slightly and look glossy. Taste and season with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, if needed. Place the chicken and it's juices back into the pan and coat with sauce. Serve. Enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 400 degrees.Make the rub for the chicken thighs by combining the whole grain mustard, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, oregano, basil, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small bowl.
