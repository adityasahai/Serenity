Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"Heat a large 12-inch skillet with a tablespoon of oil and butter over medium-high heat. Season the cubed chicken with a generous pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.Once the pan is hot, add the chicken in an even layer. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until a deep golden crust appears. Turn the chicken and finish cooking before transferring to a clean plate.Reduce the heat to medium and add in the shallots. Stir and cook until softened, adding a splash of oil if needed. Add in the sliced garlic and cook for 1 minute. Transfer the onions and garlic to the plate with the chicken.Add a teaspoon or of olive oil to the skillet and add the tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally until the skin splits and they start to burst. Throw in the broccoli and cook for a few minutes before smashing the tomatoes with the back of your spoon. Next add in the pesto, sundried tomatoes and pasta. Stir and pour in the chicken broth. Cover and bring to a boil, then remove the lid, reduce heat to medium/ medium-high and continue to simmer for 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes, if using. Add in a couple tablespoons of heavy cream and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.
