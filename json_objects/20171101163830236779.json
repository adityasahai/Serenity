Add the cauliflower, breadcrumbs, 1 cup of parmesan cheese and eggs into a large mixing bowl. Mix with a large spoon until everything is evenly combined and wet.2. Preheatyour Belgium waffle iron and greaseboth the top and bottom grids.3. Measure1/2 cup packed cauliflower mixture. Place 1/2 cup cauliflower into your palm and then compactthe cauliflower mash a few times between your palms before forming a ball. You need to compact it first, otherwise the mix will become loose while cooking and will be hard to remove off the iron. Place ball into the middleof your waffle grill and press waffle iron down as far as you can. Your cauliflower will not spread across the entire waffle iron, instead it should spread enough to form waffles that are about 3.5inches in diameter.4. Cook cauliflower waffles until they are a crispy, dark golden brown, about 7 minutes. Avoid opening the waffle iron too early to check on them. You will need to cook the waffles a few minutes longer than when the iron indicates the waffles are done, so wait at least for the ready lightbefore checking on your waffles. The longer the waffles cook, the firmer they will become. If your waffles are falling apart when you remove them, then they likely need to be cooked longer.I also recommend you use a good cookie spatula to help remove the waffles from the bottom grid as the first 1-2 may stick a little more.5. Repeat with remaining cauliflower, re-greasing the waffle iron before each one. You should have enough batter to make 8 (1/2 cup) waffles with a little batter leftover (about 1/4 cup) for a mini one.6. When waffles are finished, place one back onto the bottom grid. Add 1/4 cup of shredded cheese on top, making sure to push cheese into the crevices of the waffle. Place another waffle on top. Press your top waffle iron down, trying best to align your waffle iron with the grids on your waffles. Hold your waffle iron down until cheese is melted. Remove and repeat with remaining waffles. If you do not plan on using all of your waffles at once, you can store remaining ones in the freezer.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the cauliflower, breadcrumbs, 1 cup of parmesan cheese and eggs into a large mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg"},{"id":18079,"name":"breadcrumbs","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg"},{"id":11135,"name":"cauliflower","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix with a large spoon until everything is evenly combined and wet.2.
