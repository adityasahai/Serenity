Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples.

Whisk eggs and milk to combine. Stir panko with seasonings. Cut tilapia filets into strips and dredge in flour, then egg mixture, then panko. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of fish. Bake 12-15 minutes depending on how thick your fish is. Fish is completely cooked when opaque and flakes easily.
