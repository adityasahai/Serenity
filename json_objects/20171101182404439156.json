Cut the butter in using a pastry blender or two forks used scissor fashion until the flour mostly resembles coarse meal.Repeat with the shortening. Drizzle the ice water over top and toss with a fork. Add more ice water if the dough looks dry - it should stick together when gathered into a ball. Divide in two with one half being slightly bigger for the bottom crust. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.Blend flour, cornmeal, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a large food processor. Add butter and shortening, pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons ice water. Pulse just until moist clumps begin to form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball. Divide dough in half making one just slightly larger for the bottom crust. Flatten each half into a disk and wrap in plastic. Chill at least 1 hour.Gently toss the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon water together in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature until juices begin to form about 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 400°F. Place rimmed baking sheet in bottom of oven to catch any drips. Roll the bigger disk out on a floured surface to an 11-inch round and place in pie pan. Gently press the dough into the pie dish, pressing together any cracks and leaving the dough hanging over the sides. Spoon the filling into the pie crust.Repeat rolling out the second (top) crust or roll it out and cut out shapes with a cookie cutter.Place dough over top of filling. Trim overhang of both crusts to 1 inch and fold under, pressing together to seal. Crimp edges decoratively and cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Lightly brush top crust (not edges) with milk and sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake pie 15 minutes then reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue baking until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling thickly through slits, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool pie completely on rack. Cut into wedges and serve with lemon curd.In a large mixing bowl beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer for about 2 minutes. Slowly add in the eggs and yolks beating on low for 1 minute. Stir in the lemon juice - the mixture will look curdled at this point.In a medium heavy-duty saucepan set over low heat cook the mixture until it looks smooth. Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. It should leave a path on the back of a spoon and will read 170°F on a thermometer. Don't let the mixture boil - if it starts to bubble turn the heat down.Remove the curd from the heat and stir in the lemon zest. Transfer to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap over the top to keep a skin from forming. Refrigerate. The curd will thicken further as it cools. Good for 1 week in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt together in a large, wide bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornmeal.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut the butter in using a pastry blender or two forks used scissor fashion until the flour mostly resembles coarse meal.Repeat with the shortening.","ingredients":[{"id":4615,"name":"shortening","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Drizzle the ice water over top and toss with a fork.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":10014412,"name":"ice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ice-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add more ice water if the dough looks dry - it should stick together when gathered into a ball.
