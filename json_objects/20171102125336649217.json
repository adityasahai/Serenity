Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes (temperature should be 120-140 degrees F).Meanwhile, in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine 1 1/2 cups of the four, sugar, salt and yeast. Add the milk/butter mixture until incorporated. Add the eggs and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining flour a few tablespoons at a time until all incorporated. If needed, add more flour a tablespoon at a time to achieve a dough that clears the bowl, is sticky to the touch, but does not stick and come off on your hands. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutesShape dough into a ball and place in a greased bowl, rolling the top in the butter or oil to grease it as well. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and place in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about one hour.Punch down the dough and divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Divide each of those pieces into 3 smaller pieces. Shape into rounds and place in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and let rise again until an indentation remains when lightly pressed with your finger, about 30-45 minutes.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden brown on top, about 20-25 minutes.Melt the butter and honey together. Brush on to tops of rolls immediately when they come out of the oven.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk and butter just until the butter is melted.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes (temperature should be 120-140 degrees F).Meanwhile, in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine 1 1/2 cups of the four, sugar, salt and yeast.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the milk/butter mixture until incorporated.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the eggs and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Add the remaining flour a few tablespoons at a time until all incorporated.
