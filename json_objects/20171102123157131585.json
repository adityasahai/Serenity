Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"Mix the cornflour and 1 tbsp soy sauce, toss in the prawns and set aside for 10 mins.
