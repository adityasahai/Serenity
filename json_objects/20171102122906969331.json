A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

In a large bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter and salt. Stir to moisten and then press into the bottom of a 7-inch spring form pan OR a 9 inch pie dish. Freeze crust for 10 minutes and then bake for 10 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack while you prep the filling.Whip the heavy cream in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment until medium-stiff peaks form. Scrape the whipped cream into a separate bowl and wipe the mixer bowl out. (No need to wash it.) Switch to the paddle attachment and beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add the pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and powdered sugar, mixing until smooth.Remove the bowl from the mixer and gradually fold in about 2/3 of the whipped cream, saving the rest for the topping. Mixture will be thick and creamy. Fold in the chopped pecans and toffee bits. Spread the filling into the cooled crust. Cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight or until filling has firmed up.Spread the remaining whipped cream over the torte and garnish with a crushed gingersnap, chopped pecans, or toffee.
