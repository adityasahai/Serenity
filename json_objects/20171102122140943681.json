Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. The Marcelo Pelleriti Reserve Malbec with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":465126,"title":"Marcelo Pelleriti Reserve Malbec","description":"","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465126-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/marcelo-pelleriti-reserve-malbec-2012/149722"}]},"instructions":"Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add the tenderloins and make sure the marinade is all over the tenderloins. Turn them halfway thru the marinade time.Start the grill. You want a medium high heat around 350 degrees. Place the tenderloins on the grill directly over the coals. Cook for about 15 minutes or until pork reaches 145 degrees. Rest for at least 5 minutes before cutting.
