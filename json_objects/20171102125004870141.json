Stir until well mixed.With the back of a spoon press the dough evenly into the prepared baking pan.Place the pan on the trivet in the slow cooker.Cover and prop the lid open at one end with a wooden spoon handle or chopstick to let steam escape.Cook on HIGH, until edges are golden and set in the middle, 2 to 3 hours. (Mine were done in 2-1/2 hours.)When finished cooking, remove the pan from the slow cooker and place it on a wire rack to cool completely.In a small bowl, stir together the powdered sugar and water to make a glaze. Drizzle glaze over the cooled bars.When cool, cut into 16 small wedges.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grease a small baking pan that will fit in your slow cooker.
