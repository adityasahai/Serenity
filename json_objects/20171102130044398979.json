White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Back and better than ever!One of my all time favorite posts was my Cauliflower Hot Wings post a couple of months ago. Since then, I have made this satisfying appetizer numerous times and have perfected the recipe.As such, I thought I would update the recipe and post some new pictures to get your mouth watering ;)This last batch was made while visiting one of my very best college friends down in LA. He had seen them on my blog and asked if we could make them! So we did. Twice.Paired with Follow Your Heart Ranch dressing, these \"wings\" were hands-down the best yet. They are crunchier, chewier, more flavorful, and - best of all - even healthier!A couple important lessons I have learned through trial and error:The buffalo sauce that you use is CRUCIAL. The better the sauce, the better the wings (this should be obvious but, of course, it wasn't)The wings turn out best when baked at a relatively high temperature, broiled until just crispy, tossed with sauce and served immediately. This way they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and warm when served.This time around we used the Wing-TimeBuffalo WingSauce (the HOT version)and it was absolutely amazing. Favorite wing sauce yet, hands down.It had the perfect level of spice, creaminess and kick for these wings - plus it is sugar free, gluten free, all natural and preservative free! Also, instead ofadding earth balance when heating the sauce, I just added in a bit of unsweetened almond milk and it seemed to do the trick!OK - enough talk, here's the recipe:Cauliflower Wings1 large head of cauliflower3/4 bottle of Wing-Time Buffalo Sauce1cup +2 Tbspnon-sweetened, plain almond milk3/4 cup chickpea flour1 tsp garlic powder1 tsp onion powder1 tsp curry powder2 Tbsp nutritional yeastPreheat the oven to 450F.Lightly spray a large non-stick baking sheet with oil.Separate/chop the cauliflower into florets.Combine the flour, spices and nutritional yeast in a bowl and stir until well combined.Coata handful ofcauliflower pieces in soymilk and then with the flour mixture. Place on the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes or until crispy.While the cauliflower is in the oven,heatthe Wing-Time sauce in a medium sauce pan over low heat. Whiskin 2 Tbsp of almond milk.When the cauliflower is looking crispy, turn it with a wooden spoon andheat the oven to broil.Allow the cauliflower to broil with the oven open for 5-7 minutes or untilbeginning tobrown.Pull it out of the oven and place it in a large bowl. Pour the hot sauce mixture over it and toss to coat.Serve immediately!Isn't that beauitful!We made it two nights in a row :)Live Long and Prosper!
