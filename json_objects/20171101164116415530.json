Try pairing with Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. The Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (1 Liter Bottle) with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 130 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434608,"title":"Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (1 Liter Bottle)","description":"This wine has a signature style that is dark in color, with rich fruit and ripe, velvety tannins – as approachable in youth as in maturity. Caymus farms Cabernet grapes in eight of Napa’s 16 sub-appellations, with diversification enabling the winery to make the best possible wine in a given year. This Cabernet offers layered, lush aromas and flavors, including cocoa, cassis and ripe dark berries.","price":"$129.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434608-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/caymus-napa-valley-cabernet-sauvignon-1-liter-bottle-2015/316997"}]},"instructions":"1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).2. In a large bowl, combine the meat, eggs, and barbecue sauce, and mix well with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Stir in the pepper, onion, mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and mix gently. Slowly add the bread crumbs and mix just to thicken the meatloaf. The mixture should be moist and thick, but not firm and dry.3. Line an 11 by 4-inch baking pan or a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place the turkey mixture in the pan and smooth out the top.4. Bake until the meatloaf is cooked through but not dried out, about 50 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing to serve.5. Leftover turkey meatloaf makes great sandwiches the next day on a French roll with extra barbecue sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).2.
