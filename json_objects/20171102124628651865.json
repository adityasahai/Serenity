Taste and season with additional salt / pepper if needed. Set aside.For the falafel:Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal. Set aside.To the bowl of a food processor, add the chickpeas, green onions, parsley, garlic and lemon juice. Pulse until the mixture is well combined and finely chopped. Add the spinach to the bowl and pulse until combined and the mixture starts to pull together into a sort of large clump (scraping the bowl as needed). Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add in the flour, salt and pepper. Mix until combined and the flour is mostly absorbed, then taste and season with additional salt / pepper as needed. Add in the egg and mix again until well combined (if the mixture is too wet to form into patties, add additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Dont add too much, or youll dry out the burgers!).Scoop about  cup of the mixture and form into a patty (about 2  to 3 inches in diameter). Place on the cornmeal dusted baking sheet. Once all the patties are on the baking sheet, sprinkle the tops with the remaining cornmeal.Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in some oil (once the oil is hot, you want there to be enough so that there is a very very thin layer in the bottom of the pan). When hot, add in as many patties as will comfortably fit. Cook for about 4 minutes per side, until browned and crispy. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Repeat for all the patties.Serve with the yogurt sauce for dipping!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the sauce:In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the sauce.
