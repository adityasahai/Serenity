Cut in the butter and shortening with a pastry blender or two knives used scissor fashion until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 4–5 tablespoons of ice water until dough just holds together.Divide into 2 uneven balls one a little bigger for the bottom crust (if using small ramekins make the 2 balls even). Pat each into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the filling.Add the sausage to a large, deep-sided skillet over medium heat and cook it all the way through breaking it apart as it cooks. Drain off the grease and remove the sausage to a platter or bowl. Add oil to the same skillet and cook onion until tender and translucent; add garlic and saute until fragrant. Add the sausage back in along with the sweet potatoes, corn, Italian seasoning and red pepper. Gently mix to combine and remove from heat.In a medium saucepan melt the butter over medium-low heat, whisk in flour and cook 2 minutes. Whisk in broth then cream. Bring to a simmer and cook 2-3 minutes. Whisk in cheese and parsley.Carefully pour into the skillet over the sausage mixture. Stir gently to combine, return to medium-low heat and cook 5 minutes stirring often. Remove from heat.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. and set a baking sheet on the bottom rack to catch drips.On a floured surface roll out the pie crusts (one 10-11 inch for the bottom and one 9 inch for the top). For individual pies roll both crusts to 10 inches. Cut with a biscuit cutter or use a small bowl or plate and sharp paring knife to cut 5 - 6 rounds to fit your ramekins. You may need to combine the scraps and reroll.Place the bottom crust into a 9-inch deep dish pie plate, spoon in filling and cover with the top crust. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush over top. Cut a few slits to allow steam to escape. Bake 30 - 35 minutes until golden brown and bubbly. Allow to set 5-10 minutes before slicing. Place 5-6 well greased ramekins on a large baking sheet. Spoon in the filling leaving 1/2 inch of room at the top. Cover with crust, brush with egg and make a slit in the middle to allow steam to escape. Bake 18-20 minutes until golden brown and bubbly.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sift flour and salt together into a medium bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut in the butter and shortening with a pastry blender or two knives used scissor fashion until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
