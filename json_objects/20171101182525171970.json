Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Trombetta Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir.

Season to taste with salt and pepper (avocado tends to need a fair amount of salt).  Spread it over the chips.For the 1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes, you want to end up with almost a salsa consistency.  Season it with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over the guacamole.Mash up the beans and season with pepper (they should already be salted).  Sprinkle over the cheese.To fry the eggs, heat up a nonstick skillet over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, add the oil and crack each egg into the pan (if your pan is hot enough, the white should set immediately so the yolk stays centered).  If the whites aren't setting quickly enough on top, cover the pan with a lid so the top cooks a little bit, but make sure not to overcook the egg yolk.Set your egg on top of each plate and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by setting down one layer of tortilla chips down on the plate.Mash the avocado with the red onion, lime juice, and jalapeno.
