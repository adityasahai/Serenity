A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.

Add the remaining ingredients and blend again for another 30 seconds. Place in a glass or metal dish and chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours.Once chilled, place in an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions. Gently stir in cookie dough balls once at the soft serve stage and freeze for 2 hours. Serve. (If the ice cream is frozen for longer than 4 hours, it will get very hard. Simply remove from freezer 10-15 minutes in advance before scooping.)In a bowl, stir the coconut flour, rice flour and salt together. Using a fork, blend in the shortening and butter (or more shortening) until well blended. Your dough will be crumbly at this point.Add the almond milk and vanilla extract and combine until you have a doughy consistency (like play dough). Finally, stir in the stevia and chocolate chips. Roll the dough into tiny balls and set on a cookie sheet.
