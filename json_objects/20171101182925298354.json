Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Recipe: Mary's Basic Homemade Chicken Noodle SoupFrom the Kitchen of Deep South DishPrep time: 15 min |Cook time: 2 hours 30 min |Yield: About 8 to 10 servingsIngredientsFor the Homemade Stock:1 (3 pound) whole chickenWater just to cover (or use stock for richer flavor)2 large pinches of kosher salt1 celery rib with leaves, cut into large chunks1 large carrot, cut into large chunks1 medium onion quartered1 large bay leafFor the Soup:8 cups of reserved homemade stock, or 2 (32 ounce) cartons of chicken stock/broth1 tablespoon of chicken base (like Better Than Bouillon), optional3 garlic cloves, chopped2 stalks of celery, halved lengthwise & sliced2 carrots, sliced1 parsnip, chopped, optional1/2 of a large onion, diced2 tablespoons of diced fresh ginger, optional1 teaspoon of dried thymeFreshly ground pepperLarge handful of frozen peasLarge handful of frozen cornOptional veggies: mushrooms, diced potato, diced turnip, chopped leeks, sliced scallions, green beans, etc.2 tablespoons of dried parsley, plus additional for garnishCooked egg noodles or cooked riceInstructionsCut up chicken coarsely, splitting back and breasts. Place the cut up chicken in a tall stockpot, add the water or chicken stock only to cover chicken plus about an inch. Cover pot and bring to a boil, reduce heat, remove the lid and simmer uncovered, skimming off any foam that accumulates. When foam subsides, add the salt, celery, carrot, onion, and bay leaf. Cook, uncovered, at a steady, slow simmer for about 2 hours.Strain, but reserve the broth. Discard the vegetables. Put the broth back into the stockpot and set the chicken aside to cool. To the stock, add in the chicken base, garlic, celery, carrot, parsnip, onion and ginger. Sprinkle in thyme and pepper. Allow to low simmer until vegetables are tender.When cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones from the chicken. Tear the chicken into bite size pieces and add back to broth. Add the peas and corn, and any additional veggies you like; add parsley and simmer until tender. I prefer to cook the noodles or rice separate from the soup itself so that the noodles do not absorb most of the soup broth.Spoon cooked noodles or rice into a serving bowl and ladle the soup on top. Sprinkle each serving with a bit of additional parsley.Cook's Notes: You can use a variety of chicken parts that you've saved up for this (wings, backs, etc.), however, you'll want some additional chicken to add to the soup since the parts have done their job! Throw a few chicken thighs in the pot along with the parts - they give off a great flavor to the soup. Avoid boneless, skinless chicken breast however, as it lacks flavor and tends to overcook and be too dry. Save those for a shortcut version. The chicken base is optional if you're making homemade stock, but I like the richness that it gives to soup. If you use the base, you will not likely need to add any additional salt to the soup. If you don't use the base, you may need to salt. Either way, be sure to taste it before adding salt.Shortcut it! Omit the homemade stock and substitute a combination of water and commercial chicken stock or broth to equal 8 cups. I recommend Kitchen Basics stock, but also adding the chicken base. Proceed with the recipe as above, simmering the vegetables first and then adding in 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken. A deli roasted chicken stands in well, however, take into account the salt when you are not preparing the chicken yourself.Tip: If you are making this ahead and have time, you may also let the broth cool and refrigerate. Once well chilled, the fat will rise to the surface and harden and you can easily scoop it off. Freezes great, but do not freeze with the noodles! Just make fresh noodles when you reheat it.Creamy Chicken Noodle Variation: To make a creamy version, prepare a skillet of blonde roux of 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of flour. Cook and stir that for 3 minutes, then slowly add in several ladles of the broth from the soup, until it forms a gravy. Transfer to the soup pot. May also add in 1 or 2 cans of cream of chicken soup near the end of cooking. Stir in until blended well and heated through, then add in the chicken, peas, corn and parsley to the pot.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Recipe: Mary's Basic Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"From the Kitchen of Deep South Dish","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Prep time: 15 min |Cook time: 2 hours 30 min |","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":45,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
