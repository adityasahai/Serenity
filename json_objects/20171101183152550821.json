Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel.

In a food processor, add the first 6 ingredients. Pulse until the mixture becomes finely minced.Drain the tofu and pat dry. With a large spoon, mix the tofu and the panko bread crumbs into the patty mixture. You can taste the mixture and add additional garam masala seasoning or salt, if needed. Refrigerate the patty mixture for at least 20 minutes (or up to overnight). The mixture should be moist, but just firm enough to hold a patty shape - if it is too wet, mix in 1/4 additional bread crumbs. Shape the mixture into 6-8 patties.When ready to cook, heat a frying pan over medium heat and swirl in the cooking oil. When hot, carefully add as many patties that can fit without touching. Fry each side until it is golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Assemble the patties onto each bun with mayonnaise, arugula and cheese.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roughly chop the onion and bell pepper (it makes it easier for the food processor).
