A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Heat oven to 180C/fan160C/gas 4. Line the tart with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment, bake for a further 5-10 mins until golden, then remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 140C/fan 120C/gas 1. While the case is cooking, cut the passion fruits in half, scoop out the flesh into a bowl, then blitz with a hand blender. Push the pulp through sieve and mix the juice with the lime zest and juice. Beat the sugar and yolks together until pale, then beat in the cream and fruit juice. Carefully pour the custard into the tart case, then bake for 40 mins, until set with a very slight wobble. Remove the tart from the oven, then leave to cool completely.You can now either serve the tart as it is, or try a chef’s tip and dust it with icing sugar, then caramelise the top with a blowtorch.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roll out the pastry and use it to line a 23cm tart ring, then chill for at least 20 mins.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Heat oven to 180C/fan160C/gas 4.
