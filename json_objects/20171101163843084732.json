A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Santa Medina Port Wine . with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency.
