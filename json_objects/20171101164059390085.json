Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment.2. Put flour and baking soda in bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse to distribute the baking soda evenly. Add the butterscotch chips and process until the chips are ground, with some slightly larger bits remaining. Turn the flour and butterscotch chips out into a large bowl.3. In a separate large bowl, cream the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar together for 2 - 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl from time to time, until fluffy. Add the egg and pumpkin puree and stir to combine.4. Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine. Add oats, white chocolate chunks and nuts and stir until ingredients are combined and no flour is visible. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes or overnight.5. Use a 1/4 cup measure or ice cream scoop to drop the cookie dough onto the prepared sheets, leaving 2 inches between cookies.6. Bake cookies on center rack for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the cookie sheets halfway through for even baking, until they're light golden brown and no longer doughy looking. Cool cookies on cookie sheets for 10 to 15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack or clean surface to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.
