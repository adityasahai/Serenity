White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay.

Meanwhile, make the dressing Combine the garlic and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until the garlic is softened, about 1 minute. Transfer the garlic and oil to a blender; add the 2 whole piquillo peppers and puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the mayonnaise, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons cilantro; season with salt and pepper.
