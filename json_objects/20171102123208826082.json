Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. You could try Gascon Malbec. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437536,"title":"Gascon Malbec","description":"A classic expression of the grape, our Don Miguel Gasc√≥n Malbec opens with intense aromas of blackberry, plum and a hint of mocha. On the palate, dark fruit flavors are finely intertwined with notes of spice, licorice and chocolate for a magnificent full-bodied Malbec. Round tannins and a plush mouthfeel lead the way to a long, velvety finish.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437536-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gascon-malbec-2012/128058"}]},"instructions":"Heat a flat griddle to medium-high.                          Put the bun on the griddle to toast it. Then place the hamburger patty on the griddle and sprinkle with seasoning salt.
