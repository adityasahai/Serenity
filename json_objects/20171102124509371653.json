Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color.

Saute garlic and dried chili for about one minute until garlic just begin to brown.Add shrimp and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, until shrimp turns pink. Add lemon juice and cognac to cook for another 1 minute. Take off heat, season to taste with salt, sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately on a plate or serve right from the pan.   Heat the olive oil In a large pan over a high flame. When the oil is very hot, add garlic, pine nuts and raisins and saute for 1 minute until slightly browned. Keep stirring so the pine nuts won't get burnt. Add apple cubes and sauté until slightly browned, about a minute. Add the spinach and sauté briefly until the spinach starts to wilt. Remove from the heat; the spinach will continue to wilt off the flame. Add salt to taste and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Warm the olive oil over medium heat in a sauté pan or heavy frying pan.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Saute garlic and dried chili for about one minute until garlic just begin to brown.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add shrimp and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, until shrimp turns pink.","ingredients":[{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add lemon juice and cognac to cook for another 1 minute.
