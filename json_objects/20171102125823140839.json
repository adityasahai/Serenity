Let cool completely.Crumble cake in a large mixing bowl. Stir in enough frosting so that the mixture can be shaped into balls. This may vary, so rather than give you an exact amount I’ll say that I used about ¾ of a 15 oz can.Line a large cookie sheet or a couple of plates with parchment. Scoop up small balls of mixture and shape into footballs. This takes practice. I started with a cyclinder and kind of pinched the ends to make triangles. Chill the footballs for several hours. You’ll be able to touch them up a bit before dipping because the chilled footballs are easier to shape.Take them out of the refrigerator and shape any of the irregular footballs into neater footballs.Melt a small amount of chocolate. Dip ends of sticks into chocolate and poke the chocolate dipped stick into the football. Quickly put it on a plate in the freezer. Continue until all the footballs are on sticks. Freeze for several hours or until your footballs on sticks are nice and sturdy.Now comes the fun part! Melt the melting chips in the top of a double boiler or a chocolate melting pot. Carefully dip the frozen cake pops and tap off any excess chocolate.Stand them on a cake pop stand or poke the sticks in Styrofoam and put them in the refrigerator to chill.To make the lacing, melt some white chocolate in the microwave. Spoon it into a Wilton decorating bag and let it cool for a minute so it’s not too hot and runny. Snip the tip off the bag and carefully pipe the lacing. If you have a hard time with melted white chocolate, you can use royal icing instead. However, the white chocolate holds up better when packaged.Return pops to the refrigerator. When they are very firm, take a small piece of green cardboard, fold it in half and make a snip in the center so that you have a cut. Poke the stick through. Now put a bag over the pop and tie it off with a twist tye.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare cake as directed using the eggs, oil and water amounts noted on the box.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Let cool completely.Crumble cake in a large mixing bowl.
