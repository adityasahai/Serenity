If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé.

Using higher heat may make the cheese melt more quickly, but it also means you run the risk of lumpy queso...so keep the heat low!Add 1/4 of the cheese, whisking until the cheese is mostly melted. Continue slowly adding cheese (I recommend doing this in three parts), again whisking until the cheese is mostly melted before adding more.Stir in the salsa. If your salsa is too cold, the queso may seize up a bit. Thats okay! Keep stirring over low heat until the queso is nice and smooth again.Garnish with fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the milk in a medium saucepan over low heat.
