Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat mat.Sift flour, baking powder and salt into medium bowl.In a large bowl mix the sugar, melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract.  Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until it’s well combined. Mix in almonds.Divide the dough in half. Get some flour on your hands and shape each dough portion into a 13 inch-long x 3 inch-wide, x 1 1/2 inch thick log. Transfer both logs to the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. *They don’t expand much, so it’s ok if the logs are very close to the edge of the baking sheet.Bake the logs until they’re golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the logs completely on the sheet on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. Keep your oven on.Transfer the cooled logs to a cutting board. Use a serrated knife and cut logs into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Arrange the slices cut side down on the same baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes. Turn the biscotti over and continue baking about 10-12 more minutes, just until they’re starting to get some color. Transfer the biscotti to a wire rack and cool.  They’ll harden even more as they cool.Store on the counter for up to 1 week.  Or store them in the freezer in a plastic baggy for months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
