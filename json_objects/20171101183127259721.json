Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Line a baking sheet with tin foil then top with two cooling racks.Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise then cut each piece into half widthwise. You should end up with four pieces of same thickness chicken. Season both sides of the meat with sea salt, freshly cracked pepper, and garlic powder, to taste. Pour the flour onto a flat plate. Whisk the egg and milk together in a bowl. Pour the panko onto a flat plate.Dredge the chicken into the flour; next dip into the egg mixture followed by dipping into the panko crumbs, making sure to get an even coating. Place onto the cooling racks; repeat with the remaining chicken. Place the chicken into the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Side Note: Dont skip this step, it helps the panko adhere to the chicken.After the chicken has been in the refirgerotor for 30 minutes, remove and set on the counter for 15 minutes. Heat half of the oil into a large skillet over medium high heat. Once the pan is hot, add four pieces of the panko crusted chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes on the first side, until golden brown. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 3 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and place on a plate with a tin foil tent. Repeat the process with the remaining oil and chicken.Place the coleslaw mix, green onions, and cilantro in a bowl. In another bowl, combine the grated ginger, soy sauce, lime juice, and rice vinegar. Whisk the ingredients while adding the sesame oil into the dressing. Pour the dressing over the coleslaw mixture and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired. Side Note: I made the coleslaw when I started cooking the chicken so it would not get soggy.Combine the mayonnaise together with the sriracha sauce, to taste. We liked our sauce spicy. Set aside.Toast your hamburger buns in the oven for a few minutes, if you prefer. Slather some sriracha mayonnaise on the bun, place a piece of chicken on top then a good spoonful of slaw. Slather the top bun with more sriracha mayonnaise, if desired. Serve immediately.
