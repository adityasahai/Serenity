sweet potatoes and bake for 1 hour or until soft and tender. When the sweet potatoes are cooked, slice them in half and allow to cool 5 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.Once the flesh of the potatoes is cool enough to touch, scoop out the flesh of the potatoes, leaving a thin layer of potatoes and skin. Place the sweet potato skins (the \"boats\") on a baking sheet. Add the sweet potato flesh to a medium bowl and mash well. Add the dark brown sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil, cinnamon and vanilla. Continue to mash until smooth. Now stir in the eggs and 1/4 cup coconut milk. If the sweet potatoes seem too thick add another 1/4 cup of coconut milk. Stir until everything is combined. Spoon the mashed sweet potatoes back into the sweet potato skins. The filling should just be popping out of the skins.To make the crumble add the coconut oil, whole wheat flour, dark brown sugar, pecans, flaked coconut, oatmeal and flax to a bowl. Use your hands to works the coconut oil into the dry ingredients until everything is moist and the mixture resembles large peas. Divide the mixture evenly between the boats. Bake the sweet potatoes for 15 minutes, then remove and add marshmallows to the top of each sweet potato. Return to the oven and bake for 15 minutes or until the marshmallows are toasted.
