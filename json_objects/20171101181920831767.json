Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 25 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":469199,"title":"Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay","description":"We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless.

Slice into thin rounds (as thin as you can get them). Separate all the little rings and lay them into a shallow baking dish and cover with buttermilk (1 1/2 -2 cups). Allow to sit for 30-45 minutes. Mix together flour, salt, cayenne, and black pepper in a large bowl.Heat oil in a deep skillet to 350-375 (I love my cast iron). Using tongs, remove a small amount of the onions from the dish and allow excess buttermilk to drip off. Toss the onions in the flour mixture, shake off excess and then place into the hot oil. Shallow fry until crispy and golden (be sure to flip partway through). It takes about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from oil and place onto a place that has papertowels on it to allow it to drain. Repeat until all onions have been cooked. Set aside until ready to use.For the Salad:Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Spray grill with non-stick spray and pre-heat to medium high heat. Cook the chicken for about 4-6 minutes per side (until cooked completely through). During last few minutes of cooking, baste the chicken breasts with 3/4 cups of the BBQ sauce (make sure to get both sides). Remove from grill and set aside to rest for 3 minutes. Cut into bite sized cubes.Disperse lettuce evenly among four large salad plates or bowls. Next, add equal amounts of the tomato, corn, black beans, and avacado. Top each salad with a cubed up chicken breast followed by a handfull of the onion straws. Top with a drizzle of the BBQ Ranch Dressing and a drizzle of the remaining BBQ sauce. If desired add a sprinkle of cilatro on top. Serve. Best. Salad. Ever.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Mix all ingredients together and set aside until ready to serve.For the Crispy Onion Straws","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut both ends off of the red onion and peel off the papery skin.
