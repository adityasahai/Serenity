Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438867,"title":"Chateau Ste.

September harvest conditions were ideal with very warm, clear days and cool nights.\"Fresh pear, honeydew melon and mandarin orange aromas and flavors combine with chamomile tea, honeysuckle and assorted floral characteristics...\" according to winemaker, Erik Olsen.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thick, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.                          For the salmon: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the salmon on the baking sheet. Drizzle both sides of the salmon with the olive oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Roast until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.                          For the vegetables: In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and cook until the shallots are softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the edamame and snap peas and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.                          Divide the vegetable mixture among 4 serving plates. Top with a piece of salmon and drizzle with the glaze.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the glaze: In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar, maple syrup, mustard and garlic to a boil over medium heat.
