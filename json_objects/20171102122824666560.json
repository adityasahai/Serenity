Try pairing with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is District 7 Estate Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"1 Fava beans need to be shelled twice, first before cooking to remove the outer pod, then after cooking, to remove the tough membrane around the bean.  To remove the outer pod, work over a large bowl and squeeze the bean with your fingers, bending the pod so that when it snaps, the bean inside shoots out into the bowl. Remove all the beans from their pods.   2 Add the beans to 2 quarts of boiling, salted water.  Simmer the beans for a few minutes, until just tender.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the beans from the pan and plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and to shock the beans into a bright green color. Let the beans sit in the ice water for a minute or two, then drain them and remove the outer peel.3 In a bowl combine the freshly peeled and cooked fava beans, the sliced fennel, and onions.  Drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the mixture, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Squeeze some lemon juice over the the salad (about a tablespoon), add the Parmesan and mint, and toss to mix.  Garnish with fennel fronds and/or mint sprigs.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Fava beans need to be shelled twice, first before cooking to remove the outer pod, then after cooking, to remove the tough membrane around the bean.
