Add the pasta and prepare according to directions. Drain and set aside.Heat a large skillet with high sides over medium-high heat and cook bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Remove all but one tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan and then add 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the brussels sprouts in a single layer and sprinkle with brown sugar and salt. Let sit 1 minute and stir. Continue to saute for another 4-5 minutes, until bright green and tender. Now add the pecans and cook another 3-5 minutes. Remove everything from the pan and carefully wipe the pan clean.To the same pan add the butter, milk and mascarpone cheese. Bring to a boil and simmer until smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add the parmesan, parsley, crushed red pepper, pepper, salt and nutmeg, whisking until the cheese has melted. Simmer the sauce 3-5 minutes until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Add the pasta and brussels sprouts to the sauce and toss well, cook another 1-2 minutes to warm through. Serve immediately with fresh parmesan. If your skillet is not big enough to toss the pasta in transfer everything to a large pot or serving bowl and toss well.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pasta and prepare according to directions.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Drain and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Heat a large skillet with high sides over medium-high heat and cook bacon until crispy.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/paper-towels.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Remove all but one tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan and then add 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"Add the brussels sprouts in a single layer and sprinkle with brown sugar and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":11098,"name":"brussels sprouts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brussels-sprouts.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":9,"step":"Let sit 1 minute and stir.
