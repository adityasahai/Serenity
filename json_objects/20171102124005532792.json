Chicken in a creamy sauce can pair beautifully with a chardonnay. With the earthy mushrooms and darker sauce, chicken marsala can definitely hold up to a red wine like merlot or pinot noir. One wine you could try is Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Add the pancetta and cook until just crip and lightly browned.  Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.  Add the onions to the pan and cook until translucent and slightly browned, 5-10 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.2 Put the flour on a plate.  Pat the cutlets dry.  Season them on both sides lightly with salt and amply with pepper.  Heat the skillet with the pancetta fat over medium high.  Add more olive oil, if needed, to get about 2 Tbsp of fat in the pan. 3 When the fat is hot, dredge a cutlet through the flour on both sides.  Shake off the excess flour and immediately put the cutlet in the pan.  Do the same with as many cutlets as will fit in the pan without touching.  Sauté the cutlets, turning once, until browned on both sides.  If thin, they should cook through in just a few minutes total.  Transfer the cooked cutlets to a plate and continue sauteíng the rest, adding more oil if necessary.  Transfer these to the plate as well. 4 Pour off the excess fat.  With the pan over med-high heat, add the Marsala and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.   Cook until the Marsala is reduced by about a quarter.  Stir in the cream and boil until you get a nicely thickened sauce.  Return the chicken, onions, and pancetta to the pan and turn the cutlets over to coat.  Let them reheat for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Serve with the sauce and a sprinkling of parsley.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Coat a large skillet lightly with olive oil and set it over medium high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pancetta and cook until just crip and lightly browned.","ingredients":[{"id":10410123,"name":"pancetta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pancetta.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404636,"name":"slotted spoon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slotted-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the onions to the pan and cook until translucent and slightly browned, 5-10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.2","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404636,"name":"slotted spoon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slotted-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Put the flour on a plate.
