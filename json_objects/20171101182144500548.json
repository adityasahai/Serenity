The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Ricasoli Brolio Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Line another inverted baking sheet with parchment; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Form the pizza dough into an 8-inch oval on the parchment; flip to coat with the oil. Drape with plastic wrap; set aside.                          Combine the tomatoes and basil in a bowl. Mix the ricotta, mozzarella and mint in another bowl; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.                          Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and garlic; cook, breaking up the meat, 5 minutes. Remove to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add the broccolini and 1/2 cup water to the drippings in the skillet and cook 5 minutes.                          Stretch the dough to 11 by 14 inches on the parchment; spoon the ricotta mixture on top. Top with the tomatoes, sausage and broccolini. Slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto the hotbaking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden, 15 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board to slice.
