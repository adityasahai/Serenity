A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the onions and cook them until they are golden and reduced in volume by about half–this will take about 20-25 minutes. Stir them occasionally for the first half of cooking time, and more frequently during the last five minutes of cooking time.When the onions are golden, stir in the rosemary, salt, white pepper, and vinegar.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. For the crust, stir together the almond flour, salt, rosemary, and gruyere cheese. Add in the melted butter and egg and stir until the mixture comes together as a dough.Spray a 10-or-12-inch springform pan (a tart pan or a regular cake pan will work) with some cooking spray to coat. Press the dough evenly over the bottom of the prepared pan, and slightly up the edge. Pile on the onions and spread them out. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the tips of the onions are getting dark brown.Serve hot or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Peel the onions and slice them fairly thin.
