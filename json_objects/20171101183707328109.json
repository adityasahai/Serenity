If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Watch closely as it may boil over. Remove from heat and set aside.Sift tapioca starch into a large bowl.Pour the boiled (hot) mixture over the tapioca and start stirring with a fork.The milk mixture will not be enough to form dough yet. You will have a lumpy mixture, that's what it is supposed to be.Keep stirring with the fork, breaking down the lumps as much as you can, until the mixture cools down to warm.At this point, preheat your oven to moderately hot 400° F/200° C/gs mark 6Add the grated cheese to the tapioca mixture and mix well, now using your hands.Add one egg at a time; mix with your hands until dough comes together. lightly beat the egg with a fork and add little bits until the dough comes together into soft but pliable dough. You only have to knead it a bit, not as much as you knead yeasted bread. It's OK if it is slightly sticky.Form balls with the dough and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicon mat or lightly greased with vegetable oil. If necessary, you can oil your hands to make shaping easier. The size of the balls may vary from small bite-sized balls to the size of ping pong balls. They will puff up quite a bit after baking. I personally prefer the smaller ones.Bake it for about 25 minutes or until they just start to brown on the bottom. You may have golden spots of cheese on the crust. Don't over-bake as they will get hard and bitter.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9D8f2QtVvoY/U4UYyMkqNnI/AAAAAAAARNY/BZjPT2ywBYM/w780-h518-no/paodequeijo+055.JPG","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat milk, butter, and salt in a small sauce pan until it comes to a boil.
