Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431299,"title":"Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Luminous pear and apple notes animated with aromas of lime and lemon.","price":"$12.75","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431299-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2016-Proverb-Pinot-Grigio-750mL/dp/B074G3D221"}]},"instructions":"Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 450 degrees F. Cut the halibut into 4 pieces; arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet, cut-side down. Squeeze 1 lemon half over the fish and season with salt and pepper; spread the mayonnaise over the tops. Bake until the fish is almost cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Switch the oven to broil. Broil the fish until the tops are golden, about 3 minutes.                          Meanwhile, combine the chives, dill and parsley in a small bowl; set aside. Toss the arugula with the juice of the remaining lemon half and 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper.                          Top each fish fillet with the herb mixture. Drizzle the arugula salad and tomatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
