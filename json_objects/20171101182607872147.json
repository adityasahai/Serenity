A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.

Line the bottoms of each with parchment rounds and grease again. Set aside.Combine cocoa powder, flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk until combined. Set aside.Stir together chocolate milk and brewed coffee, set this aside as well.In bowl of stand mixer beat butter and sugar for 3 minutes until light and fluffy, scraping the sides as necessary. Add in eggs one at a time, mixing each egg in before adding the next, then mix in vanilla.Alternately add in flour mixture and chocolate milk mixture until incorporated, beginning and ending with flour mixture, scraping sides as needed. Once all ingredients are combined turn mixer to medium and beat for 3 minutes until smooth.Divide batter evenly among prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating pans once during baking.Allow cakes to cool in pans for 20 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, removing the parchment paper.Lightly toast pecans in preheated (350) oven on a baking sheet for 4-5 minutes. Or in a skillet over medium-low heat for about the same amount of time. Remove them from heat when they become aromatic. Watch closely as they will scorch easily.Cook bacon according to package directions until very crispy. Allow to cool.In blender or food processor pulse pecans, bacon and salt until it is a coarse crumb. Set aside.Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan and heat over medium until mixture comes to a boil. Boil for 6-7 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool until warm. If mixtures cools completely it will become solid. If this happens, simply heat it back up until it's warm enough to become liquid. You don't want to pour it on the cake if it's too hot...just warm enough to be pourable.In a mixer combine all ingredients and over low speed for 30 seconds.Increase speed to medium and beat for 1 minute until smooth.Let frosting cool for 15-20 minutes before you frost cake or cupcakesWhen ready to assemble fill the layers of the cake with the chocolate frosting. Cover the cake wit the frosting and using a piping bag or a zip-top bag with the edge snipped off, make a border at the top of the cake. This is to hold the caramel and bacon pecan crumble.Next pour the caramel layer on the top.Finally top with bacon pecan crumble.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350Grease three, 8\" cake pans.
