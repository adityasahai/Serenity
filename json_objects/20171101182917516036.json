Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.In a food processor, pulse the almonds until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, egg white, almond milk, lemon juice, and coconut oil. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, then fold in the mashed banana and coconut flakes.Spray the waffle iron with cooking oil (I love Trader Joe's Coconut Oil spray). Pour about 1 cup of batter onto the iron spreading evenly, the amount of batter necessary will vary based on your waffle maker so use your best judgement here. Cook until the waffle is golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to oven safe plate or baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm while you make the rest of the waffles.
