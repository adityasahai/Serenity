Add onion and saute until translucent, about 8 minutes.Soak skewers in water and set aside.Preheat grill to high heat.Top beef with sauteed onion, garlic, ginger, shallots, oregano, mint, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, pepper, and salt.Add the spice mixture to the beef and knead with your hands until thoroughlycombined.Form scoops of meat mixture into an oval shape.Thread onto skewers.Place kebabs on grill and cook for about 6 minutes. Turn over andcook an additional 6 minutes, depending upon thickness. Just be sure they are no longer pink in the centers.Remove from grill. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.If using lamb, serve with mint sauce. Mint compliments mint extremely well. Otherwise, for a sweet sauce, combine 2 parts mayonnaise with one part each honey and mustard. Creamy, gluten-free salad dressings also work well. However, as long as your meat contains enough fat,you can serve them without any sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add ground beef to a large bowl.
