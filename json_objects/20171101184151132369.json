Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Prepare the ground beef taco meat for this dish (see recipe here) and keep warm. Heat the oil in a wok or similar size pan with high sides to 350 degrees. (Note: The oil needs to be deep enough to fry the large tortilla shell so that it is completely submerged while cooking.) With a small spider strainer, press flour tortilla down into the hot oil and hold in place while it cooks into a bowl shape.  Let hot oil fill bowl of tortilla shell so inside cooks. If rim of bowl did not get browned, flip bowl over in the oil and allow the rim to cook for a few seconds until browned. Carefully remove from the oil using tongs and drain on paper towels until completely cool. Repeat for remaining tortillas.  (See our tutorial 'How to Make a Taco Shell Bowl' here).Slice corn tortilla circles into small strips and fry in hot oil until crisp and golden. Remove to paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt. Set aside.  (Optional - top your taco salad with store bought corn chips.)Place a tortilla bowl on a plate and fill with lettuce of your choice. Top with warm taco beef, then shredded cheese and diced tomato. Repeat for all portions. Then top each salad with avocado slices and Catalina dressing.Finally finish by topping with corn chips and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the ground beef taco meat for this dish (see recipe here) and keep warm.","ingredients":[{"id":10023572,"name":"ground beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fresh-ground-beef.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oil in a wok or similar size pan with high sides to 350 degrees.
