Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439141,"title":"Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio","description":"It has a straw yellow color.
