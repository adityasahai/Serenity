bowl.  Pour the boiling water over the cereal mixture and stir together; let cool slightly.Add the buttermilk, maple syrup, unsweetened applesauce and water to the cereal mixture; stir until well mixed.In another bowl, whisk together the whole wheat pastry flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.Add the flour mixture and chopped walnuts to the cereal mixture and stir until just combined.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; let stand 15 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400F/200C for 15 minutes.  Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and spray it well with non stick cooking spray, so that you can peel off the paper easily.After 15 minutes the batter looks like its fermented with little bubbles.  Now toss in about 3 tablespoons of the M&Ms if you are using.  Do not mix it too much because the colors start bleeding.  Reserve the rest to sprinkle over the muffin batter.Fill the muffin cups evenly with the batter; approximately 3 tablespoons of batter per muffin.  Sprinkle the balance M&M’s and smooth the batter lightly before putting the pan in the oven.Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20-25 minutes.  Mine was done around the 21st minute itself.Cool the pan on a rack for 5 minutes.  Remove the muffins from the pan and let cool completely on the rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine together the cereal, raisins, and oil in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":9299,"name":"raisins","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raisins.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the boiling water over the cereal mixture and stir together; let cool slightly.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the buttermilk, maple syrup, unsweetened applesauce and water to the cereal mixture; stir until well mixed.In another bowl, whisk together the whole wheat pastry flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":10020080,"name":"whole wheat pastry flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg"},{"id":9019,"name":"applesauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/applesauce.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the flour mixture and chopped walnuts to the cereal mixture and stir until just combined.
