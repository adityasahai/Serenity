Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it slides easily across the pan. Add the onions, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until the onions are soft.2. Add the sugar and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the marmalade, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the onions appear dry. Add the vinegar and reduce the heat to low. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, until the onions are soft and dry. Serve the marmalade warm or at room temperature. Store the marmalade in the refrigerator. It will keep for several weeks.Make the turkey sandwich3. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).4. Slide the sage leaves under the skin of the turkey breast and place the turkey on a sheet pan. Rub the skin with the butter and season generously with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Baste the meat with its juices throughout. (Keep in mind that the meat will continue to cook even after it’s removed from the oven, so be careful not to cook it too long.) Allow the meat to rest before slicing, or cool completely.5. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain.6. Slice the ciabatta rolls in half. Place the turkey slices on the bottom halves and top with the onion marmalade. Place the bottom and top halves of the rolls in the 350°F (175°C) oven and remove once the marmalade is heated through and the bread is toasted. Top the marmalade with the bacon, followed by the avocado. Evenly spread the mayonnaise on the top halves of the rolls. Close the sandwiches, cut into halves, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the onion marmalade1.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it slides easily across the pan.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onions, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until the onions are soft.2.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the sugar and reduce the heat to medium-low.
