White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Add the chicken and sear it on all sides. Pour in the sauce, reduce heat to medium low, cover and cook, stirring frequently, for about 7 - 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.

Test a large chicken chunk for done-ness by cutting into it with a sharp knife.In the small bowl you were using for the sauce, whisk together the water and cornstarch. Put the heat back on medium and stir the cornstarch into the chicken mixture and cook until the sauce thickens.
