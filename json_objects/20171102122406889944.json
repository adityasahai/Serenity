White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try District 7 Estate Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Save RecipePrint Recipe                          Passover Tori Tsukune Nabe (Japanese Chicken Meatball Hot Pot)                                        Shiitake Mushroom Broth Ingredients4 cups  warm (but not boiling) water5 or 6  large dried shiitake mushrooms (.75 ounces)Tsukune (Chicken Meatball) Ingredients1 lb ground chicken1 large egg1 leek, white and pale green part, finely chopped1 tbsp fresh grated ginger1 tsp fine sea saltIngredients4 cups chicken stock1/2 small napa cabbage, roughly chopped (core removed and discarded)1 medium carrot, cut in half lengthwise, then cut into slices crosswise (half-moon shape)4 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper                                                        Total Time: 1 Hour 30 Minutes          Servings: 6          Kosher Key: Meat, Kosher for Passover","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Save Recipe","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Print Recipe","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Passover Tori Tsukune Nabe (Japanese Chicken Meatball Hot Pot)","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Shiitake Mushroom Broth Ingredients4 cups  warm (but not boiling) water5 or 6  large dried shiitake mushrooms (.75 ounces)Tsukune (Chicken Meatball) Ingredients1 lb ground chicken1 large egg1 leek, white and pale green part, finely chopped1 tbsp fresh grated ginger1 tsp fine sea salt","ingredients":[{"id":1012047,"name":"fine sea salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":11246,"name":"leek","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/leeks.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Ingredients4 cups chicken stock1/2 small napa cabbage, roughly chopped (core removed and discarded)1 medium carrot, cut in half lengthwise, then cut into slices crosswise (half-moon shape)4 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper","ingredients":[{"id":1002030,"name":"ground black pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":11266,"name":"crimini mushrooms","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Total Time: 1 Hour 30 Minutes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Servings: 6","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"Kosher Key: Meat, Kosher for Passover","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
