Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.In stand mixer bowl on low speed, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt for at least 30 seconds. Pour onto a sheet of wax paper and set aside.In stand mixer using a paddle attachment, beat the butter, peanut butter, and sugars together until fluffy (about 2 minutes), scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated.With the machine on the lowest speed, slowly pour the flour mix into the batter. Mix until incorporated, stopping occasionally to scrape bowl sides and bottom.Roll the dough into balls or use a cookie scoop to form the balls and arrange apart and evenly on sheet pans.Press a 1/2\" divot into each ball. Put jam in a piping bag *see note 2. Pipe jam into each hole.Bake for 11-14 minutes or until the dough it just set (I'll usually give the nearest one a little push test to feel if it seems too soft or if it feels like it has set up). Cool on a wire rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375°F.
