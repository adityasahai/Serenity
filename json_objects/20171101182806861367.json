A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Butter six 3/4-cup ramekins. In a large bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, egg yolks, flour, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Whisk in milk. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in a medium bowl until frothy. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Fold beaten egg whites into lemon mixture in 2 additions. Divide batter among prepared ramekins, and place ramekins in a roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, taking care not to splash water into the ramekins. Bake until tops are golden and spring back when lightly touched, about 30 minutes. Remove ramekins from water. Serve warm or cold, with whipped cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place oven rack in middle position.
