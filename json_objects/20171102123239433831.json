Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Scoop by rounded tablespoonful (a 1 1/2-tablespoon cookie scoop works well) onto the prepared sheet pans, leaving space between each scoop. One dozen cookies should fit in each pan.
