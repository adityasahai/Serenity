A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Krohn Lágrima Fine Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430325,"title":"Krohn Lágrima Fine Port","description":"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine.
