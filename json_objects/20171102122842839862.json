Toss sourdough cubes in olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Lay out in a single layer on a baking sheet - use two sheets if necessary. Place in the oven and toast the cubes until they are dry, stirring half way through. Also rotate and switch the baking sheets on the rack half way through cooking. Approximately 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.Increase the heat in the oven to 350.While the sourdough is toasting, in a large skillet, melt butter and sautee all vegetables until softened. Add in the garlic, herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste.Once the vegetables are all softened, pour the sourdough bread cubes into a large mixing bowl, and top with the sauteed vegetable mixture. Pour on the chicken stock over the sourdough and vegetables - starting with 1 1/2 cups. Toss the stuffing to ensure the sourdough is soaked. Add more stock until the stuffing is moist and the all the bread is no longer crunchy.Pour the stuffing into a baking dish that has been sprayed with non-stick spray. Cover and bake for approximately 30 minutes until hot. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
