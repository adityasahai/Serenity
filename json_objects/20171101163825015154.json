dish","dinner"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{"pairedWines":[],"pairingText":"No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Saut first 3 ingredients in hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat 8 minutes or until tender. Add garlic and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Transfer to a 6-qt. slow cooker.                                                                                                 Add beef to skillet, and cook, stirring often, 7 minutes or until crumbled and no longer pink; drain. Stir in kosher salt and next 5 ingredients. Stir in wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, 7 minutes or until almost all liquid evaporates. Add to slow cooker, and stir to combine.                                                                                                 Drain tomatoes, reserving liquid. Using your hands, crush tomatoes, and break them apart. Add to slow cooker, and stir to combine.                                                                                                 Cover and cook on LOW 6 hours. Stir in cream. Check sauce; it should be thick and creamy. (If soupy, uncover and cook 30 more minutes. If dry, stir in reserved canned tomato liquid, 1 Tbsp. at a time, to thin sauce.) Discard bay leaf.                                                                                                 Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain well. Toss together pasta and 4 cups sauce. (Reserve remaining sauce for another use.) Spoon into serving dishes, and sprinkle with desired amount of cheese. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Saut first 3 ingredients in hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat 8 minutes or until tender.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add garlic and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":11887,"name":"tomato paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Transfer to a 6-qt. slow cooker.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/slow-cooker.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add beef to skillet, and cook, stirring often, 7 minutes or until crumbled and no longer pink; drain.
