Bring large pot of water to boil and add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Wash the potatoes and cut off any scars.  Add the potatoes with the skins still on to the boiling water. Test for doneness by poking a fork into the potatoes.  If the potatoes still feel hard they're not quite done yet.  Boiling time is about 45 minutes but it may take more or less time depending on the size of the potatoes.  When cooked, put the potatoes on a plate and cool them in the refrigerator. In a large bowl mix together all of the ingredients, except the potatoes, salt and eggs (set aside a small portion of the dill and bacon to sprinkle over the finished product).  Add the chopped eggs and stir into the mixture. With the skins on, cut the cooled potatoes into cubes and add to the mixture about 2 potatoes at a time.  Gently mix all ingredients together as you add the potatoes.  Salt to taste.  Garnish with bacon bits and dill.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil the potatoes ahead of time so they have time to cool.
