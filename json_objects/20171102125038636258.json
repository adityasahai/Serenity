Wash and chop the vegetables into large chunks (bell peppers, squash, tomatoes, onion). Peel four cloves of garlic but leave them whole.Toss the chopped vegetables and garlic with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Spread them out on a baking sheet (or two) so that they are in a single layer. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.Place the vegetables in the oven and roast at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. If you have two baking sheets on two different racks in the oven, youll need to switch them half way through to ensure even cooking.While the vegetables are roasting, cook the couscous. Bring 3 cups of broth up to a boil (or 3 cups of water + 1 Tbsp bouillion, in my case). Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour in 2 cups of couscous, turn off the heat, and cover the pot with a lid. Let sit, undisturbed, for at least five minutes.After the vegetables are finished roasting, transfer them to a cutting board and roughly chop. Collect the four garlic cloves and chop them well. They are probably so soft that theyll just smoosh, but thats okay. You just want them to be able to distribute throughout the salad.Roughly chop about  bunch of parsley. Fluff the couscous with a fork. Combine the couscous, roasted vegetables, and parsley in a bowl and stir to combine. Season with more salt and pepper if desired.
