Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir.  Bring the mixture to a boil and shake/swirl the pan very often (don't stir it while it's boiling) until it turns a medium amber color (should take 12 to 15 minutes).  If sugar crystals gather along the sides of the pan during the cooking process, you can use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush the sugar down the sides of the pan so that it becomes incorporated into the boiling mixture.2.  Remove the pan from heat and pour in the cream.  It will bubble up like crazy.  Give it a whisk, then add in the butter, vanilla and sea salt.  Whisk again until everything is nice and smooth.  It should be the color of caramel.  Cool it in the pan, or pour it into a large measuring cup so that it will be easier to transfer to jars when cooled.3.  Divide the sauce evenly among the four jars.  Place lids and labels on and refrigerate until ready to use or gift to friends.  The sauce must be kept refrigerated and it will stay fresh for 2 to 3 weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
