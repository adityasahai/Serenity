Try pairing with Sparkling Wine. Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. One wine you could try is MYX Fusions Myxotica Moscato ( half-bottle). It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439091,"title":"MYX Fusions Myxotica Moscato ( half-bottle)","description":"This limited edition Myxotica Moscato was released in promotion of Nicki Minaj's third album The Pink Print.
