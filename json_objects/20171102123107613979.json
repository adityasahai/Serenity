Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes.
