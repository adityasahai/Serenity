Arrange the Nilla wafers over the top of the rack and set aside.Prepare the marshmallow. Fit a large pastry bag with a 1/2 inch round tip.Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.Put 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl and sprinkle the packet of gelatin over it. Stir.In a small saucepan, combine the remaining 8 teaspoons of water, sugar, corn syrup and salt. Using medium heat, heat without stirring until a candy thermometer (I use a deep fry) registers 240 degrees (soft ball stage).While the syrup heats, beat the eggs with the whisk attachment until stiff peaks form. If eggs form peaks before syrup reaches 240, stop the mixer. When the syrup hits 240 degrees, turn the mixer back on and pour it into the egg whites in a thin stream down the side of the bowl starting with a few tablespoons and increasing the flow. Use a rubber scraper to make sure you get it all.Quickly scrape the gelatin into the still-hot saucepan and stir it so that it thins and dissolves from the residual heat. Add it to the mixer while it is still going. Add the vanilla and the coffee powder and keep on beating for 5 minutes or until bowl feels cool and mixture is thick enough to pipe. Pipe mounds of marshmallow on top of the cookies and let the marshmallow topped cookies sit on a rack for at least two hours. After the two hours have passed, you can move on to dipping OR you can freeze the cookies and dip them when convenient.For dipping, use your favorite method. I recommend tempering the chocolate, but that takes practice. So temper the chocolate if you know how, or just melt the chocolate and fat in a double boiler. Dunk each cookie one by one in chocolate and lift with two forks, letting chocolate run down the sides. Set on a rack that youâ€™ve placed over a sheet of foil or parchment to catch drips.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Spray a cooking rack lightly with cooking spray.
