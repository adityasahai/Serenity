In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus.

Spray a donut pan with cooking spray, use a paper towel to lightly spread/remove excess spray.In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the milk, eggs, vanilla, butter and oil. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mix just until combined.Transfer the batter to a large piping bag or use a ziploc bag with one corner cut off. Pipe the batter into the donut pan, filling each donut hole about 2/3 full. Add the chopped peanut butter cups to the batter in the donut pan, using a toothpick to push them into the batter. Distribute the chopped peanut butter cups evenly.Bake the donuts for 10 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let the donuts sit in the pan for 5 minutes before moving to a wire rack. Combine the chocolate and oil in a shallow microwave safe bowl and microwave on 60% power, stirring every 30 seconds for about 2 minutes. You do not want the chocolate to be too runny. Let the chocolate sit for a few minutes so it can thicken before you dip the donuts into the chocolate. Dip each donut into the chocolate, allowing the excess to fall off. Let the chocolate covered donuts sit for 3-4 minutes before adding the peanut butter drizzle. Combine the peanut butter and oil in a shallow microwave safe bowl, and microwave on 60% power for 1-2 minutes, or until the peanut butter is melted. Drizzle the peanut butter over each donut, using a spoon.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
