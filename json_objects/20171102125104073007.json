A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

In a kitchen aid bowl add 3 egg whites and half of sugar and beat well until it is very stiff and set aside. In another bowl, beat3egg yolks with 63g sugar until it become pale and creamy mixture. Then add the flour, cornstarch/corn flour, vanilla extract and melted butter. To this gradually fold in beaten egg whites in two additions with a spatula. Make sure not to break too much air bubble. Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan, bake for 12 minutes at 350F (preheated oven) or until the cake springs back when touched in the center. If necessary, run knife around edges of pan to loosen cake. Turn cake upside down onto clean kitchen towel sprinkled with 1 tablespoon powdered sugar; carefully remove parchment paper. While hot, carefully roll up cake and towel from narrow end. Cool completely on cooling rack, about 1hourWhile cake is cooling make simple syrup with equal amount of sugar and water and set aside.Place your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer for about 15-30 minutes. Place the vanilla extract, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and cocoa powder in the cold bowl. Stir in about 2 tablespoons of the cream to form a thick paste (this will dissolve the cocoa powder). Then add the rest of the cream and beat just until stiff peaks form. If not using immediately, cover and refrigerate.
