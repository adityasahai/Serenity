Combine the heavy cream, cinnamon, and zest in a small heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat.2. Whisk the eggs and sugar together in a mixing bowl until thoroughly blended. Whisking constantly, slowly add the hot cream to the egg mixture. Return to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, just until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.3. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve into a bowl. Cover the sauce with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface and cool to room temperature. Then chill for at least 2 hours before serving. The sauce will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 2 days.Make the sweet tomatillo sauce4. Put the tomatillos, piloncillo, sugar, and water into a small saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean with a paring knife (reserve the pod) and add the seeds to the saucepan.5. Cut a 6-inch square from a double thickness of cheesecloth. Crumble the cinnamon stick onto the square, add the vanilla pod, and tie the cheesecloth into a neat bundle. Add the spice bundle to the pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatillos are very soft, about 15 minutes.6. Pick out the spice bundle, and transfer the mixture to a blender jar. Blend the sauce on low speed, using quick on/off pulses, just until smooth; the tomatillo seeds should still be whole. Cool to room temperature, then chill for at least 2 hours before serving. The sauce will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 2 days.Make the cakes7. With a rack in the center position, preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Butter eight 4-ounce ramekins (see notes) and coat with an even layer of sugar. Tap out the excess sugar. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and remove it from the heat.8. Drain the chiles and put them in a blender jar. Blend with just enough water (about 2 to 3 tablespoons) to make a thick, smooth purée. Pass the purée through a fine sieve and measure out 1 1/2 tablespoons of the sieved purée. Reserve the rest for another use.9. Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the orange juice and the 1 cup sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.10. Pour the sugar syrup over the chocolate and whisk gently just until the chocolate is melted. Add the butter and stir until blended. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Whisk in the chile paste, then stir in the flour and salt just until no streaks of white remain.11. Divide the batter among the prepared ramekins and put them in a baking dish large enough to hold them comfortably (a 13-by-9-inch dish works well). Pull out the rack, put the baking dish on it, and pour enough hot water from the kettle into the dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the tops form an even, smooth, firm crust, 30 to 35 minutes.12. Serve hot or at room temperature. In either case, unmold the cakes onto serving plates and garnish each with a ribbon of custard and/or tomatillo sauce, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the cinnamon custard sauce1.","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the heavy cream, cinnamon, and zest in a small heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1053,"name":"heavy cream","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from the heat.2.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Whisk the eggs and sugar together in a mixing bowl until thoroughly blended.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Whisking constantly, slowly add the hot cream to the egg mixture.
