White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay.

Boil noodles in broth and water according to package directions. Drain noodles while reserving 1 cup of cooking liquid. In a stockpot, place cooked noodles and remaining ingredients (reserve 1/2 cup of cheese). I add one can of soup and stir in a little of the reserved liquid. If it is dry, add the second can of mushroom soup. Stir until combined and adjust seasonings to taste. Cover with remaining 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. If you mixed all ingredients in a cast iron stockpot that is ovenproof, you can just put it directly in the oven.
