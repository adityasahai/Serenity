A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and get butter, eggs and milk out of the refrigerator in time to get to room temperature before you start.2. Make the cupcakes as usual: put all the cake ingredients, bar the milk, into the food processor and combine, adding milk to bind. Using spoon and rubber spatula fill the cake cups equally and bake for 20 minutes or so, until cooked. Remember the cakes rise as they bake: there is enough mixture to fill each cup adequately even if you panic when you first look at it. The cake should be cooked through and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave for 5 minutes or so and then arrange the cupcakes in their paper liners on a couple of wire racks to cool.3. Cool the cupcakes as for the lemon cupcakes, and slice off any humped top.4. Make up the icing according to package instructions, dyeing the mixture faint lilac with a spot or two of food coloring. I like to use the solid pastes, for which you may have to go to a specialist cake decoration shop, I’m afraid; the color you’ll want here is generally labeled “grape violet.” Go carefully, though: we want pastel serenity here, not seventies record-sleeve murk.5. Top each pretty-pale cupcake with a little sprig of lavender before the icings set dry.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and get butter, eggs and milk out of the refrigerator in time to get to room temperature before you start.2.
