Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Add the tofu, mix, and store in the fridge. The tofu should be allowed to marinate for at least an hour. The longer you marinate, the more flavourful the tofu will become. For tips on pressing and marinating tofu, read the 4 Part Tofu Tutorial. After your tofu has marinated, heat about 1-2 tsp of oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add your cubes of tofu and cook until golden brown on all sides. Once browned, set aside. You can now choose whether to top your salad with hot tofu or chilled tofu.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a shallow dish, mix together all of the marinade ingredients.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the tofu, mix, and store in the fridge.
