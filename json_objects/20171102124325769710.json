Use a 1 to 1 1/2 inches cookie cutter to cut out small rounds of dough.Transfer to the prepared pan and bake for 10 minutes or until light golden brown. Let cool to room temperature.Pipe a kiss of marshmallow onto each cookie. Let set at room temperature for 2 hours.Line a cookie sheet with parchment or silicon mat.One at a time, gently drop the marshmallow-topped cookies into the hot chocolate glaze.Lift out with a fork and let excess chocolate drip back into the bowl.Place on the prepared pan and let set at room temperature until the coating is firm, about 1 to 2 hours.Note: if you dont want to make your own marshmallows, you can cut a large marshmallow in half and place on the cookie base. Heat in a preheated 350-degree oven to slump the marshmallow slightly, it will expand and brown a little. Let cool, then proceed with the chocolate dipping.In a saucepan, combine the water, corn syrup, and sugar, bring to a boil until soft-ball stage, or 235 degrees on a candy thermometer.Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let dissolve.Remove the syrup from the heat, add the gelatin, and mix.Whip the whites until soft peaks form and pour the syrup into the whites.Add the vanilla and continue whipping until stiff.Transfer to a pastry bag.Melt the 2 ingredients together in the top of a double boiler or a bowl set over barely simmering water.In a mixer with paddle attachment cream the butter and the sugar.Add the egg whites gradually and then mix in the vanilla and lemon extracts.Add the flour and mix until just well mixed.With a small (1/4-inch) plain tip, pipe 1-inch sections of batter onto a parchment-lined sheet pan, spacing them 2 inches apart as they spread. (I cut a stencil out of a paper plate.)Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes or until light golden brown around the edges. Let cool on the pan.While waiting for the cookies to cool, in a small saucepan over medium flame, scald cream.Pour hot cream over chocolate in a bowl, whisk to melt chocolate, add zest and blend well.Set aside to cool (the mixture will thicken as it cools).Spread a thin amount of the filling onto the flat side of a cookie while the filling is still soft and press the flat side of a second cookie on top.Repeat with the remainder of the cookies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a mixer with the paddle attachment, blend the dry ingredients.On low speed, add the butter and mix until sandy.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the eggs and mix until combine.Form the dough into a disk, wrap with clingfilm or parchment and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.When ready to bake, grease a cookie sheet or line it with parchment paper or a silicon mat.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness, on a lightly floured surface.
