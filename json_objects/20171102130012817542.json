A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans and set aside.2. In a small bowl whisk the egg whites, ¼ cup milk, and extracts and set aside.3. In an electric mixer mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, until just combined. Then beat in the butter and shortening until well combined. With the mixer on low speed beat in the remaining milk until the batter is smooth. Then, gradually pour in the egg white mixture, beating for one minute between each addition. Use a spatula to fold in the sprinkles.4. Divide the batter evenly amongst the two prepared baking pans and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched and a cake tester inserted comes out clean.5. Let the cakes cool for five minutes in the pan. Then invert them onto a wire rack to cool completely.6. To make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese, butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. With the mixer on low beat in the confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy.7. To make the different hues of frosting divide the frosting into six bowls. Add varying amounts of lemon food coloring or paste to each one to develop different shades of yellow. I used 5 drops in the first bowl, 4 drops in the second, 3 drops in the third, 2 drops in the four, and 1 tiny drop in the fifth. Leave the sixth bowl completely neutral with no coloring.8. First, use a little frosting between the cakes layers. Then set the cakes on a platter and frost with the shades of vanilla as you choose!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
