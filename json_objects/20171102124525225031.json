White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"In a small bowl combine diced tomatoes, one teaspoon minced garlic, one teaspoon olive oil, sliced basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Cut each zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer or into 1/8-inch thick long strips.Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add one teaspoon garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the zucchini noodles and saute for 5 minutes, until just tender. Add in 1 tablespoon parmesan cheese, one teaspoon parsley and toss to combine. Taste the noodles and season with salt and pepper as needed.Slice each chicken breast in half to create two thinner pieces. Season each side lightly with salt and pepper. Turn off heat and set aside, keeping warm until ready to serve.Heat one tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken to the pan and cook for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook the other side for 3 minutes or until no longer pink in the center. Reduce heat to low, top each piece of chicken with a slice of mozzarella cheese and cover for 1 minute to allow the cheese to melt.To serve divide the noodles evenly among 4 bowls. Add chicken and top with bruschetta.
