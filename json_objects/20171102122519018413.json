water to get a moist \"batter\".You may also want to do this in a couple batches if using a narrow blender.Once processed, in a bowl, fold the fresh strawberries into the coconut cashew batter.Roll the batter into balls (10), and place on a cookie sheet.Place the cookie sheet in the freezer so the balls can set for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, heat a small pan over low heat and slowly melt the dark chocolate.Remove the balls from the freezer and roll them in the chocolate to coat, then set back on the pan.Do this until all the balls are coated with chocolate (the chocolate will harden very quickly once it comes in contact with the chilled balls.)Place the balls in the fridge or freezer for another 10 minutes to set.Enjoy!Store what's leftover...if any ;)... in the fridge or freezer!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a food processor or high speed blender (like a Vitamix) process cashews, coconut, and agave, you may need to add 1
