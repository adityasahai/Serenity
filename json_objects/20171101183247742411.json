These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. One wine you could try is Segura Viudas Brut Reserva Heredad Cava. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 22 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448175,"title":"Segura Viudas Brut Reserva Heredad Cava","description":"Like a rich Chardonnay with bubbles, this limited production Cava rests on an authentic pewter base and comes in a handsome hand-blown bottle emblazoned with a metal crest of the Segura Viudas family.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Rinse and dry the potatoes. Remove any eyes or bad blemishes. Prick the potatoes with a fork several times on all sides. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Place the potatoes on the baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes to an hour or until you can easily poke a fork through the potatoes. When potatoes are finished, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees.Add beef and onion to a skillet over medium heat and cook until beef is browned. Drain off any excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning.Add jalapenos and garlic to the skillet and saute until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.Stir in the tomato sauce, beans, diced tomatoes and heat through. Taste. Season with additional salt if needed. Set aside.When the potatoes are cooked through, allow them to cool enough to handle. Slice in half then use a spoon to scoop out potato pulp, leaving about ¼ inch on all sides. Place the potato pulp in a bowl. You won’t need all of the pulp to refill the potatoes, so at this point you can remove about 1- 1½ cups and save it for another dish (or lunch tomorrow!). Roughly mash the potatoes until they’re in small lumps. Add the butter, Kosher salt, black pepper, green onions, and 1 cup of the cheese to the bowl and mix to combine.Place the scooped out potato halves in a greased 9 x 13 inch baking sheet. Spoon the mashed potato mixture back into the potatoes, filling almost to the top.Spoon the chili on top of the potatoes, mounding it fairly high. Cover everything with remaining cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melty and everything is heated through. Serve with additional sour cream, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
