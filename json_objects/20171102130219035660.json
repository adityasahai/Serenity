Try pairing with Bordeaux, White Burgundy, and Champagne. French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. You could try Terra Blanca \"ONYX\" Mountain Bordeaux Blend.
