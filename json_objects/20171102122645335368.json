The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. You could try Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"For the pizza dough: I often double of triple this recipe and keep the extra dough in the freezer.Place the yeast and sugar in an electric mixing bowl with a bread hook attachment. Pour 1/4 cup of warm water over the yeast ans swirl. Allow the mixture to foam for 10 minutes.Then add the remaining 1/2 cup of water, oil and salt. Turn the mixture on low and slowly add 2 cups of bread flour. Allow the mixer to run until the flour is well combined and the hook is kneading the dough. The dough should be very sticky, but still firm enough to pick up. Add a little more flour if needed. Let he mixer knead the dough for another 5-10 minutes.Drizzle olive oil around the sides of the mixing bowl, lifting the dough for good coverage. Cover the mixing bowl and let the dough rise for 2 hours.Once the dough has doubled in size dump in out on a floured work surface and cut it into 2 - 8 oz. pieces. Roll the ends under to create round balls.Then using a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to 12 inch circles. Place the dough circles on parchment paper. Lightly oil the tops and let them rest while the grill is heating.Preheat the grill to high. Meanwhile prepare the pizza toppings.One at a time, Flip the dough circles onto the grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes per side.One both pizza crusts are grilled, spread 8 oz. of hummus on each crust. Then top both with fresh arugula, tomatoes, olives, feta and drizzle with a little olive oil.Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the pizza dough: I often double of triple this recipe and keep the extra dough in the freezer.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the yeast and sugar in an electric mixing bowl with a bread hook attachment.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour 1/4 cup of warm water over the yeast ans swirl.
