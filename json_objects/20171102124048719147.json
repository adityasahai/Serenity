Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general.

In a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag, combine 1 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup lime juice, and vinegar. Add pork and let it sit and marinate for about 1 hour in refrigerator.                          In a small mixing bowl, combine all dried spices. Pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel and rub with the dry spice mixture.                          Heat oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Place the pork chops in the pan and sear on 1 side until brown. Flip over and turn the heat down to medium-low. Add onion and saute for 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and continue to cook until garlic begins to brown. Pour in the remaining 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup lime juice, and white wine. Simmer until the liquid is slightly reduced and begins to thicken. The chops should be cooked through.                          Remove the chops from pan and put on a warm plate. Continue to reduce juices in pan by half. Pour over the chops and serve immediately.                          Garnish with watercress, tomatoes and avocado.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag, combine 1 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup lime juice, and vinegar.","ingredients":[{"id":9206,"name":"orange juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-juice.jpg"},{"id":9160,"name":"lime juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lime-juice.jpg"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":221671,"name":"ziploc bags","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/plastic-bag.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add pork and let it sit and marinate for about 1 hour in refrigerator.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"In a small mixing bowl, combine all dried spices.
