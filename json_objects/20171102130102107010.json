White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

Combine 6 cups water, 1/4 cup of the honey, 1/4 cup of the chili-garlic sauce and the salt in a large glass bowl. Stir until the salt is dissolved. Add the wings and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.                          To make the basting and dipping sauce, combine the remaining chili-garlic sauce, remaining honey, sweet soy sauce, Sriracha, low-sodium soy sauce, ginger and vinegar in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside half of the sauce for serving in order to avoid contamination.                          Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Drain the wings and sprinkle them with sea salt and pepper. Grill the wings until golden, 15 to 20 minutes, turning as needed. When the wings reach the right color, continue cooking over indirect heat until they're at the desired doneness, then baste them with the sauce, turning as needed until the wings are glossy and well coated. Garnish the wings with the green onions and sesame seeds and serve with the reserved dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the chicken wings apart at the joints and discard the tips.","ingredients":[{"id":5100,"name":"chicken wings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-wings.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine 6 cups water, 1/4 cup of the honey, 1/4 cup of the chili-garlic sauce and the salt in a large glass bowl.
