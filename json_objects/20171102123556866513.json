White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try NV Mindbender Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"InstructionsHeat a heavy pan. Cast iron will work best but you can use any pan (make sure it has a thick bottom). Brush the bottom with oil. Drop in the whole chicken back (skin side down), the onion halves (cut side down) and the garlic cloves. Cook over high heat until the chicken skin, onion halves and garlic cloves brown. Flip and brown the opposite side. You’re mimicking roasting — all the browning results in caramelization which will give the broth a deep flavor and golden color.Lift out the chicken, onion halves and garlic cloves and transfer to a pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.Scoop out the chicken, onion halves and garlic cloves.Add the pasta to the broth. Cook for five minutes, stirring a few times during the first two minutes.Add the carrot and squash cubes (or whatever vegetables you’re using). Stir in the tomato paste. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Cook for another 10 minutes.While the pasta and vegetables simmer, pull off the chicken meat from the bones. Peel the onion halves and garlic cloves. Tear the onion into smaller pieces. Mash the garlic.Stir the Béchamel sauce into the soup. Add the chicken, onion and garlic. Stir. Taste, adjust the seasonings, if needed. Wait until the soup simmers then turn off the heat.
