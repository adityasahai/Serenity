These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it. The Vineyards Late Harvest Riesling with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431536,"title":"Vineyards Late Harvest Riesling","description":"Pale yellow in color, the nose opens with aromas of fresh pineapple, juicy nectarine and citrus notes. The wine fully coats the palate expressing vibrant flavors of orange blossom, tart granny smith apple and honeycomb.

Roll the pie crust on a lightly floured surface until about 1 inch larger in diameter than the top of a 9-inch pie pan. Fold the crust in half and transfer it to the pie pan and unfold it. Carefully cut the edges of the pan so it hangs just below the lip and then tuck the edges underneath to form a neat crust rim then crimp the edges of the crust. Toss the apples with the lemon juice, sugar, flour and salt in a large bowl and set aside. In another large bowl, combine the butter, flour, brown sugar and salt and blend with a pastry blender into pea size pieces. Add the oats and pecans and combine. Mound the apples into the pie crust then sprinkle with the oat topping. Lightly cover the edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Cover the entire pie with aluminum foil if it seems to be baking too quickly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Drizzle with caramel sauce, slice and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Roll the pie crust on a lightly floured surface until about 1 inch larger in diameter than the top of a 9-inch pie pan.
