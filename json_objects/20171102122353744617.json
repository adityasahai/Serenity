Remove the meat from the food processor and combine it in a bowl with the onion and a handful of black olives, using your hands to mix thoroughly all the ingredients and have a smooth stuffing.Put the remaining turkey thighs between 2 sheets of cling film and batter them with a rolling pin to roughly 1 cm thickness.Preheat the oven to 180°C.For the pastry, mix the plain flour and the whole wheat flour with salt and the pimentòn in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Combine the melted butter and water in a saucepan and bring to the boil, then stir into the flour with a wooden spoon to form a smooth dough. Leave the pastry for 5 minutes to handle.Line a 20cm wide, 10cm deep pie mould with grease proof paper and grease everything lightly.Take two-third of the dough and roll into a circle large enough to line the pie mould and with excess to hang over the edge. Carefully fill any tears or breaks.Cover the bottom of the pie with half the sliced ham and half the remaining turkey, followed by all the bacon and turkey mixture, seasoning between layers and pushing everything down as you go. Follow with the remaining ham, then the remaining turkey, remembering to season between each layer.Brush the edges with the egg yolk and cover with the pastry lid. Carefully crimp the edges to create a seal and trim the edge with a knife. Brush the pie with the egg yolk and make a hole in the middle of the pastry lid. Cook for 1 hour.Remove the pie from the mould using the grease proof paper to help you and brush the sides and top again with egg before baking for a further 15 minutes.Remove from the oven and leave to cool.Serve it with a generous dollop of mustard and enjoy it!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"On a low heat, cook the onion in the butter for 4 - 5 minutes until soft.In a food processor, mince half of the turkey meat, the smoked bacon, the pimentòn and the sea salt.","ingredients":[{"id":1012047,"name":"sea salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/raw-bacon.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the meat from the food processor and combine it in a bowl with the onion and a handful of black olives, using your hands to mix thoroughly all the ingredients and have a smooth stuffing.","ingredients":[{"id":1059195,"name":"black olives","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-olives.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the remaining turkey thighs between 2 sheets of cling film and batter them with a rolling pin to roughly 1 cm thickness.Preheat the oven to 180°C.For the pastry, mix the plain flour and the whole wheat flour with salt and the pimentòn in a bowl and make a well in the centre.","ingredients":[{"id":20080,"name":"whole wheat flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":98913,"name":"turkey thigh","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404746,"name":"rolling pin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/rolling-pin.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":180.0,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":4,"step":"Combine the melted butter and water in a saucepan and bring to the boil, then stir into the flour with a wooden spoon to form a smooth dough.
