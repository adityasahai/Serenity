Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"Cook the rice according to package directions.In a small bowl or glass measuring cup combine the honey, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, ginger, garlic and wasabi powder (if using). Whisk until the wasabi powder has dissolved and add the green onions and sesame seeds. Place the salmon in a ziplock bag and add about 1/4 of the dressing. Reserve the remain dressing. Place the salmon in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Trim, core, and peel pineapple. Cut off the two ends and stand the pineapple on one end.With a chef’s knife, cut away the rind, curving your cuts between the rind and flesh. Proceed around the sides of the pineapple until all the rind is removed. Now cut through the pineapple, just to the side of the hard, inner core. Cut all the way down. Continue cutting around the core until you have several long wedges of pineapple. Cut the wedges into spears. Place half of the pineapple spears in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the dressing. Save the other half of the pineapple for eating!Preheat your grill to high. (you can also use your stove or broiler)Make the Honey Glaze. In a small bowl whisk the honey, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sesame seeds and wasabi powder until the wasabi powder is disolved. Set aside.Fluff your rice and mix with 3-4 tablespoons of the remaining dressing and the sugar snap peas, keep warm while you grill the salmon and pineapple. When the grill is hot, place the pineapple on the grill and grill 6-8 minutes or until caramelized, flipping half way through cooking. Add the salmon, flesh side down, when you flip the pineapple. Grill about 3-4 minutes and then flip, baste with a little of the dressing and grill about another two to three minutes. Remove both the salmon and pineapple (this can also be done under your broiler or on the stove). Remove the skin from the salmon and cut into four equal pieces and chop the pineapple into bite size pieces.To assemble lettuce wraps, place 1 or 2 pieces of lettuce on a plate and top with 1/4 of the rice, drizzle some of the remaining dressing over the rice and top with a piece of salmon. Top the salmon with the chopped pineapple and then drizzle the honey glaze over top of the salmon and pineapple. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the rice according to package directions.In a small bowl or glass measuring cup combine the honey, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, ginger, garlic and wasabi powder (if using).","ingredients":[{"id":10111990,"name":"wasabi powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/wasabi.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404766,"name":"measuring cup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/measuring-cup.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk until the wasabi powder has dissolved and add the green onions and sesame seeds.","ingredients":[{"id":10111990,"name":"wasabi powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/wasabi.jpg"},{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":12023,"name":"sesame seeds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place the salmon in a ziplock bag and add about 1/4 of the dressing.
