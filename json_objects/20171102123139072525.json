White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":469199,"title":"Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay","description":"We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless.
