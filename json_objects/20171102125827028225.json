Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":459422,"title":"Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia","description":"Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia is certainly the most representative wine of Cecchi. Produced only in years in which the grapes reach the quality desired it comes from the area of Castellina in Chianti. The color of excellent limpidity is of an intense ruby red. The aroma reveals broad and ethereal notes of ripe fruit and spices. The structure is elegant.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/459422-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-chianti-classico-riserva-di-famiglia-2014/240545"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small saucepan, heat broth and keep warm.
