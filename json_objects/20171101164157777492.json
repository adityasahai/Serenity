Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Franciscan Estate Merlot with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":443286,"title":"Franciscan Estate Merlot","description":"Our Oakville estate produces distinctive, supple Merlot characterized by flavors of cherries and plums.

Once hot, add corn. Stir and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and bring to a boil. Let simmer for 1 minute. Turn off stove, set aside to cool. Place butter, baking powder and salt in medium bowl; allow mixture to rise to room temperature. Then use the paddle attachment for an electric mixer or hand mixer to whip. Add cooled corn/milk mixture to bowl and blend with butter, baking powder and salt mix. Using mixer on slow speed, gradually add cornmeal and flour until mixture forms into dough, about 3 minutes. Remove dough from mixer, place on clean counter. Knead dough until soft, should not be sticky or dry. Wrap dough in plastic and place in refrigerator. For Steak: Season steak with salt and pepper, to taste. Place a wide pot over medium heat; add 2 teaspoons of canola oil. Once a haze begins to rise from the pot, use tongs to carefully place steak into pot. Saut until deep golden brown. Using tongs remove steak, set aside on a plate to cool. For Soup: Keep stove on. Place onions, garlic, chiles and cumin in the same pot used for the steak, stir occasionally for 5 minutes or until ingredients are golden brown. Pour in beef broth, water and tomato puree, bring to a boil. Cover pot with lid, turn heat down and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn stove off, set aside to cool. Pour cooled soup base into a blender, puree ingredients until smooth. Once smooth, pour soup base back into pot, add pinto beans. Set aside. Remove dumpling dough from refrigerator, unwrap plastic. Pull off large marble-sized pieces. One at a time, hold dough piece in the palm of your hand and use your thumb to press dough into a boat shape. Once all are done, bring soup base to a simmer and then place dumplings into pot. Cover with lid, cook for 10 minutes. Add steak, lime juice, salt and dumplings to pot and bring soup to a boil. Turn off stove. Ladle soup into bowls; serve even amounts of steak, beans and dumplings. Garnish with fresh cilantro.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For Dumplings: In medium-sized pot over medium-high heat pour 1 teaspoon canola oil. Once hot, add corn.
