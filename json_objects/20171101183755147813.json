Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"InstructionsCut the chicken into serving-size pieces. Cook the breast separately and use for another dish — Waldorf salad, for instance.Sprinkle the cut-up chicken with salt and pepper. Mix. Throw in the corn starch and toss to coat each piece of chicken well.Heat the cooking oil.Over high heat, fry the chicken in two to three batches until nicely browned. You are not cooking the chicken through at this point, you’re just creating a nice crust to give it texture as well as adding flavors by allowing the natural sugars of the chicken to caramelize a bit. So, don’t cook the chicken to death.Drain the chicken. Pour off the oil leaving only about a tablespoonful. DO NOT scrape off whatever browned bits are stuck on the bottom of the pan.Reheat the pan. Saute the onion, garlic, ginger, sliced kaffir lime leaf and chilis, scraping the bottom of the pan to let the browned bits mix into the vegetables.Add the bell pepper, whole kaffir lime leaf and pineapple. Season lightly with patis.Throw in the chicken. Stir.Cover the pan, set the heat to low and let the chicken cook in the juices that the pineapple will expel. It’ll take about 20 minutes. Halfway through the cooking time, taste the sauce (yes, sauce will magically appear!) and add more patis, if needed. If the pineapple is unfortunately not sweet enough, you can balance the flavors with a little honey.When the chicken is done, turn off the heat, give the sauce one last taste and make adjustments, if needed.Sprinkle the chili chicken and pineapple with cilantro before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the chicken into serving-size pieces.
