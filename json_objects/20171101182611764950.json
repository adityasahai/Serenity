A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Cover with plastic wrap and poke holes into the surface with a toothpick.Let sit for 4 hours at room temperature.Prepare a large pastry bag with a circle tip and place in a tall glass.  Line 3 cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper.Add the erythritol to the stand mixer bowl with the egg whites and whisk attachment.  Mix on low to incorporate.Add cream of tartar to the stand mixer bowl and whisk on medium speed until they reach a soft peak.Take bowl off stand mixer, dump in the erythritol/almond flour mixture and fold together.Scoop batter into the prepared piping bag and pipe 1\" rounds about 3\" apart.  Let sit for 40 min. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and line an oven rack in the center and another rack just below it, but wide enough so a pan can fit in there and you can access it with your oven glove. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until puffy and edges are golden brown.Remove Silpat from pan and let cool on the counter undisturbed.  The macarons will sink/flatten (my favorite macarons out of these three trays are from the middle tray, which was on the lower oven rack and nicely browned around the edges.  The browning, to me, makes these macarons taste so much better.  Kind of like barbequed food.  The grill marks add so much flavor and are far tastier than the same food steamed)Top half of the completely cooled macarons with the caramel sauce.Sprinkle some sea salt over the caramel sauce and sandwich another macaron on top.  Serve immediately.Prepare a large pastry bag with a circle tip and place in a tall glass. Line three cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper.Add egg whites to a stand mixer bowl with whisk attachment. Whisk on medium/high speed for 2 minutes, or until foamy.Add 30g of the powdered erythritol to the stand mixer and beat on high speed for 3-5 minutes, or until stiff peaks form.While the stand mixer runs, sift the rest of the powdered erythritol (200g) with the pistachio flour into a bowl.When stand mixer mixture is ready, dump the erythritol/pistachio mix on top. Fold the mixture slightly, add the food coloring, and fold again (mixture should be thick but fall/plop off the spatula after a few seconds... this isn't the regular macaron batter where it falls in thick ribbons)Preheat the oven to 280 degrees Fahrenheit.Scoop batter into the prepared piping bag and pipe 1\" rounds about 3\" apart (they should look like hershey kisses).Tap the pans on the counter HARD to dislodge any air in the macarons. Flatten the \"hershey kiss spikes\" on top of the macarons JUST SLIGHTLY, do not press the macarons down or flatten them.Let the macarons sit for 30 minutes, then bake for ~13 minutes (edges should be just slightly golden brown). Let cool on the baking sheet undisturbed.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the yogurt and coconut oil. Microwave at 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until coconut oil is melted (not hot!)Stir in the vanilla paste and butter extract. Pour mixture into a stand mixer with whisk attachment.Add the powdered erythritol to the stand mixer and mix on low, then high, for about a minute, or until fluffy.While mixing, slowly sprinkle in the strawberry powder and food coloring.  Scoop frosting into a piping bag and pipe onto half of the macarons.Sandwich the macarons and serve!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the egg whites into a stand mixer bowl.
