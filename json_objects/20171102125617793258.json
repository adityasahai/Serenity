Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":469199,"title":"Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay","description":"We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless.

Add cashews and coconut flakes to blender or food processor and process until cashews are about the size of the panko crumbs, scraping the sides of the blender as needed. Add cashews/coconut, panko, chicken tender spices and brown sugar to a shallow dish and mix until evenly distributed.Place the flour in another shallow dish. Whisk the egg with the lime juice in another shallow dish. Working with one chicken tender at a time, dredge in flour and then dip in egg, and then finally coat in the coconut/cashew/panko mixture, pressing mixture into chicken with your fingers to make sure the coating sticks.Place chicken tenders on a foil-lined baking sheet (for easy clean up!) with a baking rack on top that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Lightly spray chicken with non-stick cooking spray for extra crispiness (optional). Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Broil until coconut is nicely golden, and panko crisp, but still light in color.To make the Mango Honey Dip, place all the ingredients in a blender, starting with just 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes and process until smooth. Taste and add additional red pepper flakes as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add cashews and coconut flakes to blender or food processor and process until cashews are about the size of the panko crumbs, scraping the sides of the blender as needed.","ingredients":[{"id":12087,"name":"cashews","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cashews.jpg"},{"id":10018079,"name":"panko","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/panko.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add cashews/coconut, panko, chicken tender spices and brown sugar to a shallow dish and mix until evenly distributed.","ingredients":[{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":12087,"name":"cashews","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cashews.jpg"},{"id":10018079,"name":"panko","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/panko.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Place the flour in another shallow dish.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Whisk the egg with the lime juice in another shallow dish.
