Wait for five minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. Add in 3.5 cups of flour, and the salt. Then using the dough-hook, mix on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add in1/4 cup more flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is only slightly sticky to the touch. (Only use up to 4 cups of flour total.) Continue mixing on low speed for4-5 minutes. Then form the dough into a ball with your hands and transfer it to a greased bowl. Cover with a damp towel or paper towel, and let rise for15 minutes.Gently punch the dough down and divide into 15 equal-sized pieces. Formeach piece into a ball and placeevenly in the prepared pan.
