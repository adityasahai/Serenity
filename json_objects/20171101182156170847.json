Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Felsina Chianti Colli Senesi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442678,"title":"Felsina Chianti Colli Senesi","description":"Deep ruby with violet hues.

In another pot, heat butter and remaining olive oil over medium heat. Once butter melts stir in shallots and cook just until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in arborio rice just until it is coated in the butter. Do not brown. Pour in wine and cook until wine absorbs. Pour one ladle of hot broth over the rice and stir consistently until the liquid is absorbed. Repeat process, one ladle at a time, until all liquid is absorbed by the rice.
