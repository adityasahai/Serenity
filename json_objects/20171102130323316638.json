Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. You could try Luigi Bosca Malbec. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438334,"title":"Luigi Bosca Malbec","description":"Luigi Bosca Malbec is an intense purple colour wine, with distinct aromas of ripe red fruits, spices and black pepper. The intensity of the entry in the mouth is complemented with the softness and sweetness of tannins, respecting the characteristics of the grape variety in Argentina. A pure, full-bodied, well-structured red wine with character and all the juiciness typical of this variety. A long lingering and elegant finish.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438334-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/luigi-bosca-malbec-2011/132493"}]},"instructions":"Using a food processor, finely chop the onion, carrots, garlic, walnuts and sunflower seeds then transfer to a large bowl. I prefer to process each ingredient individually to achieve the best texture.Next add the cooked lentils to the food processor and pulse until they appear slightly pureed, then transfer them to the bowl as well. *Be careful not to over process the lentils. You don’t want them to turn to mush--there should still be some shape to at least half of them. See picture in the post as an example.Once you have all of the vegetables, lentils, nuts and seeds in the bowl, add the breadcrumbs, herbs/paprika/salt&pepper, and the flax meal then stir everything together.In a small bowl, combine the beaten eggs with the tomato paste and the Worcestershire. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with vegetables and lentils and stir together. Sprinkle in the flour a little at a time as you continue to stir. If the mixture seems too wet, add more flour as needed.Form eight individual patties with your hands, making sure to keep them somewhat flat with rounded edges. They will hold together better if they aren’t too thick or too big.At this point you can refrigerate them until you are ready to cook (for up to 2-3 days) or cook them right away.When you’re ready to cook them, start by warming the olive oil over medium-heat in a skillet for at least five minutes. Once the skillet is thoroughly heated, cook the burgers on each side for about 5-6 minutes. I like the push the edges of the burger to the side of the pan as I cook them to make sure they are cooked on the sides as well.Serve on a warm bun with desired toppings and dig in!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Using a food processor, finely chop the onion, carrots, garlic, walnuts and sunflower seeds then transfer to a large bowl.
