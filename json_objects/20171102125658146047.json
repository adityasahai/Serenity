Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8-inch square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with edible wafer paper, cutting pieces as needed to get them to fit; set aside.2. Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; set aside.3. Place the honey in a medium saucepan. Pour the sugar and salt into the center of the pan. Cook the mixture over medium heat, without stirring, until the honey starts to boil around the edges of the pan, about 5 minutes. 4. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, gently swirling the pan, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is dark amber in color and reaches 320 degrees F on a thermometer, anywhere from about 8 to 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the bubbles subside, about 30 seconds.5. Meanwhile, when the honey mixture is at about 270 degrees F, turn the mixer to medium-low and begin whipping the egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until soft peaks form, about 2 to 3 more minutes. 6. Reduce the speed to low and carefully add the hot honey mixture, trying to avoid the sides of the bowl and the whisk as much as possible, and mix until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and whip, scraping down the sides of the bowl twice, until the mixture is pale and very thick and stiff, about 10 to 12 minutes.7. While the candy mixture is whipping, spread the almonds on a rimmed baking sheet and heat until warm and just barely fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and keep the almonds on the baking sheet to keep warm.8. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the warm almonds and vanilla to the candy mixture. Working quickly, scrape the candy evenly into the prepared pan using a rubber spatula that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Cover the top surface of the candy with a single piece of edible wafer paper, trimmed to fit the pan. Place parchment paper on top and press very firmly with another 8-inch square baking pan to compact the candy and remove air bubbles. Let the pan cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until very firm, about 2 hours.9. Discard the parchment. Use a paring knife to trim any excess pieces of edible wafer paper from the edges, then turn the candy out onto a cutting board. Cut the torrone into pieces about 1x2-inches. The torrone can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks, using parchment to line the container and separate layers.Note: Below are the links to the specialty items I purchased for the torrone:Edible Wafer Paper (Amazon.com)Whole Blanched Almonds (Nuts.com)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
