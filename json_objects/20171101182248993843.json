They should still remain white.Cut out a small hole in the center of each cookie. Fill in each hole with filling. Press the two sides together. Combine dulce de leche, together with cookie crumbs and crushed walnuts. Pour a cup of milk into each of the two bowls. Color milk in each bowl, pink and peach, using food coloring. To create a peach color, combine an equal amount of pink and green colors.Dip each side of the cookie, into a different color, followed by sugar. Let the cookies dry overnight, on a baking sheet.
