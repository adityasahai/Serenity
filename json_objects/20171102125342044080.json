Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Pacific Rim Riesling with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Set the pork chops on a cutting board and season both sides of each chop with the spice blend. Heat a large skillet over high heat for 1 minute. Add the canola oil, and once it shimmers, add the chops. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, without moving the chops, until they are nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the chops and cook on the other side until browned and the centers resist light pressure, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and set aside. To cook the zucchini: Add the zucchini to the skillet with the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini softens, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the herbs, then transfer the zucchini to a medium bowl. Stir in the tomato, olive oil, and lemon juice, then sprinkle with the feta cheese. Divide the zucchini among 4 plates and serve with the pork chops.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To season and cook the pork chops: Stir together the oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
