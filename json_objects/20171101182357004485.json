Drain and pat dry with paper dowels. Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan set over low heat. When butter has fully melted, remove from heat and let sit for about 5 minutes, to 110-120 degrees F.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine 2 cups of the flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and milk mixture, followed by the eggs, mixing until smooth. Add the orange zest, juice and cranberries. Add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough clears the bowl but it still sticky to the touch. Continue to knead on medium speed for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.Gently punch down dough and knead a few times. Let sit for a few minutes, then divide dough in half. Working with each half individually, roll into a rectangle 12x7 inches. Slice into 12 7-inch strips. Tie each strip into a knot and place 2 inches apart on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375.Bake knots until tops are golden brown, about 12-14 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.To make the icing, combine the powdered sugar with enough orange juice to reach a moderately thick consistency. Drizzle generously over the knots. Let sit 5 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the dried cranberries in a small bowl and cover with water and let sit for 1 hour.","ingredients":[{"id":9079,"name":"dried cranberries","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-cranberries.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain and pat dry with paper dowels.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan set over low heat.
