A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.

Line the bottom of each cupcake holder with granola - about 1/4\" thick (no need to break out your ruler - anywhere close to that is fine).    If the granola is already baked (or store-bought), simply set the tin aside.  If you are using a homemade granola recipe that you haven't baked, bake the cupcake tin with the granola at 350 F for ten minutes.    Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl and set aside.    In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs and sugar for about 2 minutes, or until light and creamy.    Add the butter and vanilla and beat on low speed for about 1 minute, or until well blended.    Beat in the dry ingredients on low speed until blended.    Add the sour cream and beat until smooth and well blended.    Spoon the cupcake batter over the granola-filled liners until the liners are each about halfway full.    Bake at 350 F for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean and the tops are firm.    Take the cupcakes out and turn them upside down.
