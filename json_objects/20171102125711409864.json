A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners. Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, use the back of a fork to mash the banana until only very small lumps remain. Add the yogurt and the egg and use the fork to whisk the mixture together until completely combined. Add the oil, milk, and vanilla, and stir to combine. Add the sugars and stir again.Using a spatula, stir in the cocoa powder, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Mix until the cocoa is completely incorporated. Stir in the salt and baking soda, then gently fold in the flour, until just combined.Divide the batter among 12 paper-lined muffin cups, about 3/4 full. A cookie scoop works best for this. Top with the chopped chocolate or chips, if using.Bake for 16-19 minutes, rotating once, until the muffin tops look set, and a cake-tester inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let cool in the muffin tin for 5-10 minutes, before removing and cooling completely on a baking rack. Serve warm or at room-temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prehear the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
