Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Cook farro according to package directions and drain.Mix farro with shrimp, tomatoes, onion, mint, capers, lemon juice, feta cheese, lettuce and olive oil.Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook farro according to package directions and drain.","ingredients":[{"id":10020005,"name":"farro","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/farro-or-spelt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix farro with shrimp, tomatoes, onion, mint, capers, lemon juice, feta cheese, lettuce and olive oil.Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1019,"name":"feta cheese","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/feta-cheese.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2054,"name":"capers","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/capers.jpg"},{"id":15152,"name":"shrimp","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shrimp.jpg"},{"id":10020005,"name":"farro","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/farro-or-spelt.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mint.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
