You shouldn't need to use it all (which is fine because you can use any leftovers for topping the truffles).Once you have a dough that's easy to form into balls, scoop out 1 Tablespoon amounts and roll/carefully form into balls. Set on parchment paper and place in freezer to chill.Next melt chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Once melted, stir in coconut oil (or sub canola) to help the chocolate thin and become easier to dip the truffles.Remove truffles from freezer and, one at a time, dip them into the melted chocolate. Use a fork to remove them and tap away excess chocolate. Transfer back onto parchment paper and top with pretzel pieces or additional crushed pretzels. You will likely have leftover chocolate, which I recommend using to either double dip the truffles or dip pretzels in (because it's fun).Repeat until all truffles are dipped. Place back in the freezer or fridge to set. Store leftovers in an airtight container or bag at room temperature. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place peanuts and/or almonds in the food processor and process until you reach the consistency of a meal.Then add in pretzels and process until only small bits remain.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove mixture from bowl and aside.Next, place soaked dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and/or it forms into a ball.Next, add the peanut butter and mix until well combined.Then add in the pretzel-nut mixture a little at a time and mix until a dough is formed.
