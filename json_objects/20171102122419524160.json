A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Catherman's Port.

Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, reserving the fat in the pan.
