Meanwhile, cut up cold butter into cubes and place in separate bowl. Place both in freezer for 10-15 minutes to chill.Remove butter and flour from freezer. Add chilled butter to food processor bowl--and pulse several times or until the butter is roughly the size of peas and distributed evenly throughout the flour mixture.Add 4-5 tablespoons of ice water and pulse several times. Continue to add water (and pulsing a few times) until dough just comes together. Depending on moisture and humidity levels, the amount of water that you may need will change.Remove dough to counter top and seperate into two equal size rounds (flatten slightly into discs).Using hands, knead dough together briefly to form a ball (add an additional tablespoon of water at a time, if more is required).Allow to chill in fridge for roughly 2 hours or overnight.In large bowl, combine all filling ingredients and toss gently with a spoon. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.After dough has chilled, remove one disc of dough (roll bottom pie crust first) from fridge at a time. Place dough on a well floured surface, dust with more flour, and roll out evenly into a large, roughly 12-13” diameter disc—rotating the dough continuously as you go. Fold into quarters and transfer to a standard pie dish to unfold. Using knife or kitchen scissors, trim any remaining overhang to one inch. Brush off any excess flour with a pastry brush.Roll out remaining dough disc into a large, roughly 12-13\" diameter disc--using a pastry or pizza cutter, cut dough into 1/2\" strips.Add filling to pie pan. Lay out 4-6 strips across the filling, leaving about a 3/4\"-1\" inch gap between each. Fold back every other strip half way. Place one long strip perpendicular to the rest of the strips (in the center). Unfold the folded strips over the perpendicular strip.Fold back each strip that is under the perpendicular strip and lay down another strip perpendicular. Unfold the strips back over. Repeat with remaining strips until the enter pie is covered evenly.Trim any overhang to the diameter of the pie dish.Fold the rim of the bottom crust over the lattice strips and crimp using a fork or your fingertips.Brush the top of the pie crust with a milk wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Place pie dish on foil-lined baking sheet (this prevents any juices from overflowing onto your oven floor and creating a smoke-filled kitchen) and bake for roughly 20 minutes.Turn down temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake for another 30-40 minutes until crust is golden brown. **If crust is beginning to brown too quickly, cover with a foil tent for remainder of baking time.Remove and allow to cool on wire rack for at least 20-30 minutes. Serve warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream (or allow to cool completely if you prefer a thicker, less runny pie)!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine flour, salt, and sugar in bowl of a food processor.
