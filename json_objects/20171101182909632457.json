Try pairing with Riesling, Chardonnay, and Pinot Noir. Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. One wine you could try is Eroica Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":434655,"title":"Eroica Riesling","description":"This Eroica shows the crisp acidity of the 2007 vintage, which was the best acidity holding year in the past five years. The wine delivers mandarin orange and sweet lime aromas and flavors with subtle mineral notes. The cooler September, along with selecting fruit from higher elevation and cooler sites, contributed to the mouth-watering acidity balanced by beautiful Washington Riesling fruit.An amazing pairing with sweet, flavorful Dungeness crab.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434655-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/eroica-riesling-2007/96190"}]},"instructions":"Combine all the ingredients except the ginger, garlic, and pork chops, in a food processor.
