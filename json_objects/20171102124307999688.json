In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus. The natural acidity gives this wine a perfect balance that is refreshingly crisp and leaves your mouth watering. A perfect party wine, or can be enjoyed with a variety of foods from seafood and poultry to oriental food and fresh salads.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434166-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/schmitt-sohne-relax-riesling-2008/99841"}]},"instructions":"Take out your 4 eggs and bring to room temperature. I crack mine in the blender and let them sit for 20 minutes or so.Add the apple cider vinegar, water and ¼ cup of melted coconut oil(not hot so you don't cook the eggs) blend on low for 30 seconds.Then add in the coconut flour, garlic power, salt, ground caraway seeds and baking soda and blender for one minute.Grease your baking tin with the 1 tsp coconut oil. I used two small mini loaves for this recipe.Pour the batter in your pans and bake at 350 degrees for 40 - 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.Optional - if you want to get that nice golden look - 1 minute before you take the bread out of the oven, rub a small tsp of coconut oil on the top and broil on low until you get the color you want.Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Take out your 4 eggs and bring to room temperature.
