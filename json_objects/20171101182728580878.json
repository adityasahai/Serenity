Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
