Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"Make the chimichurri sauce first. Place cilantro, parsley, kosher salt, cumin, red wine vinegar and crushed red pepper in a food processor. Pulse the food processor and slowly add in the olive oil until the mixture emulsifies, about 1 minute. Let set at room temperature until ready to use.Season the salmon liberally with salt and pepper. To assemble skewers, thread one piece of salmon followed by one lime slice. 5 - 6 salmon pieces per skewer. Repeat until all salmon is skewered. Preheat a grill over medium high heat. Spray grill with non-stick spray. Grill salmon 2 - 3 minutes per side or until cooked through. Remove skewers from grill, drizzle with chimichurri and serve. You will likely have left over chimichurri, keep leftovers refrigerated and pour over grilled steaks and chicken.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the chimichurri sauce first.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place cilantro, parsley, kosher salt, cumin, red wine vinegar and crushed red pepper in a food processor.
