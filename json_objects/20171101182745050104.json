Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Selvapiana Chianti Rufina with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436167,"title":"Selvapiana Chianti Rufina","description":"This is a big and juicy Chianti Rufina, offering delicious strawberry and cherry aromas followed by subtle notes of spice box, leather, earth and mushrooms.

Slice off the bottoms of the onion halves so they will sit flat on the grill. Brush the bell pepper and onion halves with 2 teaspoons of olive oil.                            Place the sausages, onions, and peppers on the preheated grill. Cook and turn the sausages until well browned and juices run clear. Cook vegetables until tender and peppers are slightly charred. Remove vegetables and sausages from the grill.                            Place the peppers in a paper bag, close, and cool slightly. Remove and discard the charred skin from the peppers; slice peppers into strips. Slice the onion halves. Place salt and pepper to taste, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Add the peppers and onions, and toss until evenly coated. To serve, place sausages in sandwich rolls, and top with the pepper and onion mixture.
