Add wine and stir quickly. Mixture will bubble and wine will get absorbed by the rice.Move the rice mixture to the sides of the pan and place the beef and pork in the center. Stir and mix the meat to cook until no pink shows, about tem minutes leaving the rice pressed to the sides of the pan while cooking. Add both stocks, tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, parsley, salt and pepper. Stir to combine all contents and keep on heat just until mixture is hot. Remove the pan from the burner.Top mixture with parmesan cheese.
