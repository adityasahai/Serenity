These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it. The Vineyards Late Harvest Riesling with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431536,"title":"Vineyards Late Harvest Riesling","description":"Pale yellow in color, the nose opens with aromas of fresh pineapple, juicy nectarine and citrus notes.

Press the pie crust into the 9 pie plate as directed and chill until ready to fill. Note: make sure to use a 8-9 pie plate for this pie; using anything bigger than 9 will result in a not full pie!Whisk eggs, corn syrup, sugar, butter, salt, and cornstarch in a large bowl.Place chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie crust and place the pecans in a single layer on top of the chocolate chips. Pour the filling over the top. The pecans will rise to the top of the pie. Note: its important that the chocolate is on the bottom because the chips will weigh down the pecans and not let them rise, so make sure to put the chocolate in first!Place the pie on a cookie sheet. Tear off 4 long strips of aluminum foil (about 1 1/2 wide) and wrap the edges of the pie crust so it doesnt brown too quickly. (Or cover with a pie shield.)Bake for 10 minutes at 425F. Then lower the temperature to 350F and bake for 35-45minutes or until the pie is puffed and browned. Remove from oven and cool completely before serving. (I chill mine overnight and then bring it to room temperature before serving.) Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze (whole or slices) for up to one month.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425F.
