A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Butter a 13 by 9 by 2 3/4-inch baking dish then pour peaches into baking dish and toss with lemon juice. In a small mixing bowl whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and the nutmeg. Sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over peaches then toss to evenly coat, set aside.For the topping:Sift cake flour into a large mixing bowl. Add in all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk 20 seconds. Cut butter into flour with a fork or pastry cutter until it resembles coarse meal then make a well in center of mixture. Mix vanilla with buttermilk then pour buttermilk mixture into well in flour and stir with a spoon just until combined (don't over-mix, it should be lumpy). Dollop and just lightly spread spoonfuls (I did 12 across the top) of the mixture evenly over top of peaches (it will seem like there's not quite enough but it will bake up nice and fluffy and fill up the pan). Whisk together remaining 1 Tbsp sugar with 1/2 tsp cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over top. Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden brown and set and and filling is bubbling well, about 40 - 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool several minutes before spooning into bowls.
