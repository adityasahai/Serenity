Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tramin Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448227,"title":"Tramin Pinot Grigio","description":"Bright yellow in color with coppery reflections and clear fruit aromas of pear, citrus, honeysuckle, tropical fruits and light spices.

Whisk in the toasted sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, dry sherry, and arrowroot powder. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened. Remove from heat and set aside.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, white pepper, garlic, and coconut aminos. Stir in the chopped vegetables, half of the green onions, and the shrimp.Place enough avocado oil in a skillet to completely coat the pan. Heat over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, spoon in a third of a cup of the egg mixture and let it brown well on one side. Flip carefully and brown the other side. Remove the cooked pancake to a plate and repeat until you have cooked all of the pancakes.To serve, place two of the pancakes on a plate and spoon on some of the sauce. Garnish with reserved green onions and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the sauce, pour the chicken stock into a small saucepan.","ingredients":[{"id":6172,"name":"chicken stock","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/broth.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk in the toasted sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, dry sherry, and arrowroot powder.","ingredients":[{"id":20003,"name":"arrowroot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":10114106,"name":"dry sherry","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dry-sherry.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove from heat and set aside.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, white pepper, garlic, and coconut aminos.
