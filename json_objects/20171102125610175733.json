A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Butter and flour a 12-cup bundt pan and chill it while you prepare the batter.Whisk together the sugar and lemon zest. For extra lemon flavor you can rub the zest into the sugar with your fingers for a minute. Beat the lemon sugar and butter together until fluffy. Then add the lemon juice and beat on medium until combined.Add the eggs one at a time.In another bowl whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Add the flour mixture in thirds, alternating with the yogurt, starting and ending with the flour. Mix between each addition JUST until the ingredients are barely combined. Be careful not to over mix (this gives you ultra tender pound cake).Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes. Check with a skewer for doneness.Let the cake cool IN the pan for about 30 minutes. CAREFULLY turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.To make the glaze, whisk together the 2 tablespoons lemon juice with the powdered sugar. Drizzle the glaze over the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325F.
