Line an 8x8 baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute. Pour butter into prepared pan; set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, cheese, seasoning blend, baking powder, optional salt, and whisk to combine; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup milk and sour cream until smooth. Pour wet mixture over dry, folding to incorporate. Batter will be very thick, and dense, with lumps. If your batter is so thick it resembles paste, add up to 1/4 cup milk, or as necessary, to thin it out. Carefully turn batter out into pan, right on top of the melted butter. Smooth batter lightly with a spatula and push it into the corners. If some of the butter sloshes up and covers the batter, it's okay. With a knife, score the batter into 9 pieces (3 horizontal slices, 3 vertical slices); be careful not to slice too deeply and rip the foil. Scoring the batter makes post-baking slicing easier. Bake for about 22 to 24 minutes, or until bread is set, domed, golden, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow bread to cool in pan for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving. If any butter pooled in bottom of pan, drizzle it over the top. Serve with butter, cream cheese, olive oil or your favorite dip. Bread is best fresh, but will keep airtight for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425F.
