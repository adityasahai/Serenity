mixture resembles coarse sand. Add the egg yolks, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt and mix until a dough forms. Shape the dough into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Lightly butter a 10-inch deep-dish pie pan.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Roll two thirds of the dough out into a circle large enough to line the pan and hang well over the sides. If you like, make a series of “fret” shapes along the outer edge of the dough. To do that, fold the edges of dough over, and cut into the edges and gently press “fret” shapes by pinching the dough between thumb and forefinger at a distance of about ½  inch  apart. With a fork, pierce the bottom and sides of the crust all over.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Roll the remaining dough out into a circle and cut into strips to form lattices over the top of the filling.

Let cool to room temperature. Squeeze out all the excess water, then finely chop the spinach in a mini food processor. Set aside.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            In a food processor, grind the almonds until the texture resembles coarse sand.

Pour into the bottom piecrust. Sprinkle with the pine nuts and top with the dough strips in a lattice pattern. Bake for about 1 hour, until golden.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Cool to room temperature on a wire rack, then sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Make the crust: In a large bowl, in a food processor, or on a work surface, combine the flour, butter, and sugar until the mixture resembles coarse sand.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the egg yolks, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt and mix until a dough forms.
