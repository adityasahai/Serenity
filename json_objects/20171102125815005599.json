Try pairing with Lambrusco Dolce, Late Harvest Riesling, and Vin Santo. These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it. The Vineyards Late Harvest Riesling with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Line a 9-inch pie plate with the dough; crimp the edges. Pierce the bottom all over with a fork, then refrigerate 15 minutes. Line the crust with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Place on a baking sheet and bake until set, about 7 minutes. Remove the foil and weights; continue baking until golden, about 6 more minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.                          Meanwhile, spread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake until golden, about 8 minutes. Combine the apples, 5 tablespoons sugar, the butter, lemon juice and vanilla in a saucepan; cover and cook over medium heat until the apples are tender, about 12 minutes. Uncover and cook, mashing and stirring with a potato masher, until saucy and starting to caramelize, about 12 more minutes; let cool 15 minutes. Transfer the apples to the pie crust and sprinkle with the toasted almonds.                          Beat the egg whites and salt with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff, 2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Pipe around the edge of the pie, then pipe in a lattice pattern. Bake until the meringue is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely.
