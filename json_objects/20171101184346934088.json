Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Mix briefly.  Add the butter in pieces, mix until the mixture has the consistency of cornmeal.  Add the vanilla and mix just until a ball forms.Divide into 3 balls {about 8.5 ounces each}.  Add food coloring of your choice and 2 tablespoons of flour to each ball.Roll out each portion of dough between sheets of waxed paper into a rectangle about 11 x 8 1/2-inches.Peel wax paper on one side and lay one layer on top of  other. Leave the wax paper at the bottom of the bottom layer to help with the rolling process.   Roll into a jelly roll and wrap.   Place sprinkles into a 9×13 pan, roll the log until completely covered.Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to slice. {overnight is best}  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Slice the log into 1/2 inch thick cookies, insert Popsicle stick.Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, until the cookies are no longer shiny on top and the bottoms are golden.  Cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes before carefully removing to a wire cooling rack.
