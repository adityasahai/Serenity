White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try NV Mindbender Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color. The aromatics are complex and welcoming with floral and citrus tones mixed with hints of honeysuckle and butterscotch. The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Combine chicken, buttermilk, onions and garlic in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.    Preheat oven to warm setting.    Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy bottom skillet over medium heat.    Transfer chicken to a colander to strain buttermilk.    In a bowl combine flour and seasoning salt. Dredge chicken so that it is completely coated. Shake off excess flour.    Once the oil reaches 325 degrees fry the chicken pieces until golden brown about 10-12 minutes per-side or until the chicken is cooked through. (Note: If you do not have a thermometer to check the temperature of the oil simply sprinkle some flour in the oil, if it sizzles the oil is ready.)    Transfer to a cooling rack on top of a cooking sheet. Place in the oven to keep warm while you prepare the gravy.    Reserve 3 tablespoons of chicken pan drippings.    In the same pan that you fried the chicken in, whisk together the pan drippings and flour. Cook for 1 minute over medium heat. Slowly whisk in 1 1/2 cups of milk. Add seasoning salt and pepper. Cook until gravy thickens, stirring constantly. Add more milk if desired.    Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve alongside gravy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine chicken, buttermilk, onions and garlic in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
