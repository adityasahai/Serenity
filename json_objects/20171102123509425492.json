Add the ribs and marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature.                          Heat a grill pan over high heat. Strain the short ribs, reserving the marinade. Cook the ribs on the grill pan until dark caramelized grill marks appear, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Cut the ribs in between each bone to create square pieces.                          Strain the reserved marinade through a fine mesh strainer and cook in a saute pan over high heat until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Set aside for serving.                          For the fried rice: Add the jasmine rice and 3 cups of water to a medium saucepot. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to medium low and let simmer until cooked, about 15 minutes.                          Heat a saute pan over high heat. Add the sesame oil, carrots and onions and cook until caramelized and dark brown. Add the garlic and cook until dark brown. Add the soy sauce and cook, scraping up the bits from the bottom of the pan, until the soy sauce is reduced by half. Add the kimchi and eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are scrambled and fluffy. Add the scallions and peas.                          For the kimchi slaw: Combine the red cabbage, green cabbage, kimchi, rice wine vinegar, honey, mayonnaise and black sesame seeds in a medium bowl, using your hands to mix the ingredients until evenly distributed. Leave the mix out until ready to plate. Strain out excess liquid before serving.                          To serve, spoon the fried rice on each plate in a 4-by-1-by-1/2-inch line. Layer 4 to 5 short ribs on top of the fried rice in a cascading fashion. Top the meat with the strained slaw. Finish with a drizzle of reduced marinade and sprinkle with some sesame seeds and scallions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the pineapple soy-glazed short ribs","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the pineapple juice, lemon-lime soda, mushroom soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, brown sugar, honey, garlic, sesame oil and sriracha in a medium mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":1022053,"name":"rice vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":9273,"name":"pineapple juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pineapple-juice.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":1016168,"name":"sriracha","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the ribs and marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Heat a grill pan over high heat.
