Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.Mix first 9 ingredients in a large mixing bowl (flour thru M&M's). Set aside.Melt butter in the microwave - approximately 40 seconds, until almost melted but not bubbly hot. Let cool for 1 minute, then whisk in Irish Cream Liquor and eggs. Whisk until well blended.Make a well in the center of dry ingredients. Pour liquid mixture into center of well and stir until most of the dry ingredients have mixed in. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead 8-10 times until dough comes together. Divide into quarters.Shape each section into a log shape, squeezing together and flattening until desired thickness. I made these a little smaller than I normally do - about 1 inch thick if that. I wanted smaller biscotti! :)Place log on cookie sheet spacing each log about 2 inches apart. You may need to use two cookie sheets if you don't have one large enough for the spacing. Whisk together egg and almond milk and brush tops and sides of biscotti liberlly. Bake in oven approximately 20 minutes, or until log feels firm to the touch and looks dry.Remove from oven and cool about 10 minutes, until just cool enough to handle. Once cooled, cut each log crosswise in a diagonal shape approximately 1/2\" thick. Line up on cookie sheet cut side down and return to oven. Cook for 10 minutes, remove cookie sheet and turn biscotti over. Return to oven and bake 10 minutes more. Remove from oven and cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.
