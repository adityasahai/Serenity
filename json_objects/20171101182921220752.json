Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Finca La Malena Malbec with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431374,"title":"Finca La Malena Malbec","description":"100% Malbec from eastern Mendoza. Limestone and clay soils, cool winters and warm summers provide great fruit concentration, and smooth tannins. Dark ruby in color reflecting light in an array of orange/purple hues. Pleasant nose filled with hints of red forest fruits and herbs. Young round tannins give it a silky sensuous texture that leads to a rich mouthfeel. Mouthwatering layers of red berries, plum, vanilla and spice open as it warms up, delivering a rich varietal character. A delicate finish that bridges the gap between drinks and lingers well after the last sip.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431374-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Finca-Malena-Malbec-750mL/dp/B01N9QTXGO"}]},"instructions":"1. In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, ground coriander, mint, and lemon zest, preferably with your fingers. Form the meat into 10 patties, making sure not to compress the patties too much. Try to make the patties slightly wider than the buns as they’ll shrink a bit during cooking.2. Heat a charcoal or gas grill or a grill pan to medium-high.3. Season the patties liberally on both sides with salt and place on the grill or grill pan, in batches if necessary to avoid crowding them. Cook the patties 4 to 5 minutes per side, depending on your desired degree of doneness. I love these burgers somewhere between medium-rare and medium.4. When the burgers are almost but not quite done, crumble some feta on each so it can melt. Also place the buns on the grill or grill pan to toast.5. Place a burger on each of the bottom buns and top with some cucumber and arugula. Squeeze a reserved lemon wedge over each burger and sandwich with the tops of the buns.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, ground coriander, mint, and lemon zest, preferably with your fingers.
