Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Butter an 8 by 8 inch pan. Line with parchment and butter the parchment.    Make the cake. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and baking powder. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. I did this by hand, but a hand or stand mixer would also work. Add eggs and vanilla and mix to fully combine. Add bourbon and mix until fully incorporated. Add half of the flour mixture and mix only until barely combined. Mix in sour cream. Mix in the rest of the flour until you have a thick cake batter with all flour combined. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Top with sliced peaches in even rows, some overlapping is fine.     Make the topping. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sugars, cinnamon, and salt until fully incorporated with no big lumps. Add the butter. Stir until all of the dry mixture is moistened and clumps of various sizes are formed. Pour topping evenly over cake and fruit.    Bake for 70 to 80 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the very center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, rotating halfway through if necessary. Make sure the toothpick has crumbs, or the cake may still be liquid in the middle. It will be golden brown on top. Some of the crumbs will become very crunchy, if you do not want this to happen, cover the cake after about 60 minutes of baking. Cool in pan for at least 1 hour. Make the glaze.  In a small bowl, stir together sugar and bourbon until fully incorporate, adding more sugar or bourbon as necessary until a glaze that can be drizzled is achieved.  Drizzle over the cake.Cut into 9 pieces and serve warm or at room temperature. Store for up to 2 days at room temperature or frozen, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months. Thaw pieces at room temperature for several hours or in a 350 degree F oven for 10-15 minutes, wrapping in parchment if you wish to prevent it from becoming crunchy. Whole cakes will take much longer to thaw.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 by 8 inch pan.
