White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe.

Attach a deep-fry thermometer, and turn the heat to medium-high. Bring the temperature up to 350°F. Meanwhile, combine the flour, black pepper, and salt in a shallow bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a second bowl. Add the chicken tenders to the buttermilk. Using a pair of tongs, pull up one tender and hold over the bowl to let the excess buttermilk fall back in. Transfer the tender to the flour mixture and toss until coated. Repeat process until all the tenders are coated.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            When the oil is at the right temperature, add the tenders (if they all fit in one layer) and cook until golden brown, about five minutes.
