Put a smaller bowl inside the bath.Before starting the caramel, ensure there are no distractions in the kitchen and that there is a clear path to a sink with cold water. Caramel can be dangerous, so it needs your undivided attention. In a heavy saucepan, heat the sugar. Do not stir until the middle starts to turn brown and the edges are still white. Use a heatproof spatula to bring the white edges to the center. Continue stirring and pushing around until all of the sugar is an amber color (don't let it get too dark). Remove from the heat and very carefully pour in some of the heavy cream. It will spit so be careful. Finish pouring in the cream (if it hardens, put back over the heat and keep stirring until it's smooth again).Return the pan to the heat. Add the remaining 1 cup milk and bring to a boil. Boil for 4 minutes. Whisk in the cornstarch slurry. Boil 1 minute or until it slightly thickens. Remove from the heat then stir in the cream cheese and salt until melted. Stir in the vanilla.Strain the ice cream mixture into the bowl that's sitting in the water bath. Bring to room temperature.Freeze the ice cream according to your machine. If making by hand, chill in the refrigerator then transfer to the freezer. Whisk every 30-45 minutes to break up any ice crystals.When the ice cream is a few minutes from being done, add the caramel sauce, pecans and Rolo pieces.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon milk to make a slurry.In a measuring cup, mix together the heavy cream and corn syrup.Fill a large bowl with ice and make a water bath.
