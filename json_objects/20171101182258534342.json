Or, place the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, use 50% power and stir frequently just until the chocolate is melted; do not overheat as chocolate will burn easily. Set aside to cool slightly. Tip: Create a double boiler by filling a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer. Turn the heat off and place a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl on top of the hot water, the upper pan should not touch the water.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the eggs and  cup granulated sugar; using the whisk attachment, beat on low speed about 1 minute or until blended, and then increase the mixer speed to high and beat for 5 to 8 minutes or until the mixture is very thick and drops in ribbons when the beater is lifted. Lower the speed to low and beat in the vanilla until mixed, and then increase the mixer to high and beat another 30 seconds or until it thickens again. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly. Tip: continue beating the eggs until the sugar syrup is cooked.Meanwhile, in a medium size heavy-bottomed pan combine  cup granulated sugar and corn syrup. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan.Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 238 degrees F, a soft-ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: As soon as the syrup reaches 238 degrees F. immediately remove from the heat and pour the syrup into a glass measuring cup to stop the cooking.Quickly, as soon at the sugar syrup is done cooking, stop the mixer, pour a small amount of syrup into the beaten eggs, immediately turn the mixer on to high speed and beat for 5 to 10 seconds still using the whisk attachment. Turn the mixer off again, pour a little larger amount of syrup in the eggs, and immediately turn the mixer on to high speed for 5 to 10 seconds. Continue with the remaining syrup. Tip: You want to work quickly as the sugar starts to harden and thicken pretty quickly. Dont allow any syrup to pour onto the whisk as it will spin the syrup around the sides of the bowl.Once all the sugar syrup has been added to the eggs, continue beating the mixture at high speed, about 5 minutes longer, or until the mixture is cool. Tip: Touch the mixture and make sure it has cooled to room temperature. Also the outside of the bowl should feel cool to the touch.Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a balloon type wire whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold in the chocolate, one-third at a time. Be sure the chocolate is thoroughly folded through the batter.Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into a larger pan with sides and set both pans in the oven. Make a bain-marie (water bath) by pouring about 1 inch of very hot water into the larger pan. Tip: A large roasting pan works well for the outer pan.Bake: Bake 40 minutes. Remove the 9 inch pan from the water bath and place on a wire cooling rack to cool for 20 to 30 minutes then remove cake from the pan and place the cake on a cake plate to finish cooling. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or until chilled.Serve cake at room temperature or chilled.Before serving, place sugar eggs on top with a small amount of royal icing to hold the eggs in place.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt butter, semisweet chocolate and unsweetened chocolate.
