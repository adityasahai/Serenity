Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple.

To make the jalapeno-smoked corn butter: In a food processor, add the softened butter, jalepenos, smoked corn, salt, vinegar, hot red pepper sauce, and white pepper. Process until fully blended. Turn the machine off occasionally and scrape the sides of the processor bowl with a rubber spatula to insure that the ingredients are fully blended. Transfer the corn butter to a small bowl and refrigerate.                          Season each fish fillet on both sides with the seafood seasoning. Season lightly and evenly. Place the fish fillets on a shallow baking pan and drizzle the top of each fillet with about 1 tablespoon of clarified butter. Add the seafood stock (or water) to the pan. Use just enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pan. Place the fish under the broiler and cook until done, 6 to 8 minutes. While the fish is cooking, make the sauce.                          Heat 2 more tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring constantly, just until the outside of the shrimp turns pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the shallots and cook, stirring constantly, for 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the skillet from the stove and carefully add the wine. Return the skillet to the stove and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Add the smoked corn butter in small spoonfuls and cook, shaking the skillet constantly, just until the butter melts into the sauce. Remove from heat. To serve, place 1 fish fillet on each plate. Top each fillet with 3 shrimp and about 1/4 cup of sauce. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the broiler.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"To make the jalapeno-smoked corn butter: In a food processor, add the softened butter, jalepenos, smoked corn, salt, vinegar, hot red pepper sauce, and white pepper.
