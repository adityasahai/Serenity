Preheat the oven to 350°F (325°F for a convection oven). Grease three 9- by 1½-inch round cake pans, two 8-inch by 2-inch square pans, or one 13- by 9-inch pan, line with parchment paper or waxed paper, and grease again.To prepare the chocolate: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl, pour the boiling water over top, and stir until melted. Let cool. Stir in the vanilla.To make the batter: Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, beat the butter on low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium, gradually add the sugar, and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time. Stir in the chocolate. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk (4 portions for the flour; 3 portions for the milk) beginning and ending with the flour, until smooth. The batter will be rather thick.  In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites on low until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and beat until stiff but not dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Fold one fourth of the egg whites into the batter, then fold in the remaining whites.Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans. Bake until a wooden tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when lightly touched, 30 to 35 minutes for 9-inch rounds; 45 to 50 minutes for the 8-inch squares; and 45 to 50 minutes for a 13- by 9-inch.  Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove the cakes to wire racks and let cool completely, at least 1½ hours. The cake can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.To make the frosting: In a medium saucepan, cook the milk, sugar, butter, egg yolks, and salt over medium heat, stirring constantly, until bubbly and thickened or 170°F, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla. Stir in the coconut and pecans. Let cool, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to spread, about 30 minutes.To assemble: Place a cake layer on a serving plate, spread the top with one third of the frosting. Arrange a second cake layer on top, spread with one half of the remaining frosting, top with the remaining cake layer, and spread the remaining frosting on top. Or for a sheet cake, spread the frosting over the top and sides; or cut the cake lengthwise into thirds and layer. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Do not freeze. VARIATIONSSubstitute 2 ounces (55 grams) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate and 2 ounces (55 grams) unsweetened chocolate for the sweet chocolate.German Chocolate Cupcakes: Divide the batter between 24 (2½-inch) cupcake tins lined with paper liners, filling them about 2/3 full, and bake for about 25 minutes. After cooling, spread a layer of the frosting over top of each cupcake.Hawaiian Chocolate Cake: In the frosting, substitute 1 cup chopped toasted unsalted macadamia nuts (4.75 ounces/135 grams) for the pecans, reduce the vanilla to ½ teaspoon, and add 1 teaspoon dark rum.Chocolate Tomato Cake: Substitute 1 cup unseasoned tomato sauce for the buttermilk.German Chocolate Upside Down Cake: This is a late 20th century adaptation, influenced by black bottom cake.     Omit the frosting; scatter 1 cup shredded coconut and 1 cup chopped pecans in the bottom of a greased and floured 13- by 9-inch baking pan; top with the batter; beat together 8 ounces cream cheese, ½ cup (1 stick/4 ounces/115 grams) unsalted butter, and 2 cups confectioners’ sugar until smooth, then drop spoonfuls over top of the batter; bake as above.HINTS – To Toast Pecans: Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and bake in a 350-degree oven, shaking the sheet occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Position a rack in the center of the oven.
