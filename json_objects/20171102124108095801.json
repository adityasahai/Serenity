Heat the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Pour out the batter, 1/4 cup at a time, onto the pan, making 4 pancakes. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side. The pancakes are ready to be flipped when numerous bubbles appear on the surface. Place two pancakes on two plates.                          For the topping: Combine the butter, rum and brown sugar in a medium skillet set over high heat. Stir constantly until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Add the bananas and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, sprinkle in the vanilla and cinnamon, and baste if the cinnamon clumps.
