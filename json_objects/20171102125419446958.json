A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port.","productMatches":[{"id":469322,"title":"St. Barthelemy Cellars Merlot Port","description":"With its bright and shimmering regal red color, the Merlot port is pleasing to the eye. Soft legs cling to the glass and the nose conjures up nougat and caramel with a hint of blackberry. A smooth mouth-feel gives way to a burst of spice while hints of licorice and blackberry are followed by a finish of almonds. Enjoy this delightful port with pâtés, chèvre and nutty cheeses.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/469322-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/St-Barthelemy-Cellars-Merlot-375mL/dp/B00A6ER878"}]},"instructions":"Line a cookie sheet with parchment or wax paper and set aside.Put the cookies in a food processor and process on high until cookies are tiny crumbs.Put peanut butter in microwave for 15-25 seconds, just enough to slightly soften, you do not want it to be melted or hot.Pour crumbs and peanut butter into medium size bowl and mix together until completely combined.With spoon or a 1 tbsp cookie scoop, scoop out mixture and form into balls. I found it easiest to keep a piece of parchment paper next to where you are working and form the scoop of mixture into a ball as best you can, then put the ball down on the parchment paper and very gently roll it around with the palm of your hand until the edges are smooth. Place rolled ball onto cookie sheet and repeat until all the mixture has been made into tablespoon size balls.Place cookie sheet of cookie balls into the freezer for 30-60 minutes. This will make them MUCH easier to dip.Remove the cookie balls from the freezer and quickly melt your dipping chocolate.If using Almond bark this will take one or two minutes in the microwave ( I do 1 minute and then check and stir it and then do 15-20 second increments until it is nice and melted and smooth.Place a cookie ball into the melted chocolate and with a small spoon, make sure it is thoroughly coated and then carefully remove and place back onto the cookie sheet. Add sprinkles at this point if you are using them. (if you wait to long the chocolate will be set and the sprinkles won't stick.Repeat dipping the cookie balls until you are finished.You can leave them out at room temperature, or if your house it hot you can keep them in the fridge.I like to place each one in a mini muffin liner and place them on a cute plate or in a cute box or tin and give them as gifts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a cookie sheet with parchment or wax paper and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404739,"name":"wax paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/wax-paper.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the cookies in a food processor and process on high until cookies are tiny crumbs.Put peanut butter in microwave for 15-25 seconds, just enough to slightly soften, you do not want it to be melted or hot.","ingredients":[{"id":16098,"name":"peanut butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/microwave.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour crumbs and peanut butter into medium size bowl and mix together until completely combined.With spoon or a 1 tbsp cookie scoop, scoop out mixture and form into balls.
