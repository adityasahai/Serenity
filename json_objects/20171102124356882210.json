The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 Â°C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450 degrees.    Grease a large baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Heat in preheated oven for 3 minutes.    Roll out the pizza dough. Don't worry about the crust being perfectly round or square.    Bake the pizza dough on the prepared baking sheet for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and rub the crust with the garlic clove. Brush the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the crust. Spread the pork over the top. Top with sliced onions, jalapenos and cotija cheese. Bake on a rack near the bottom of the oven for 10 - 12 minutes or until the crust turns golden.    Remove pizza from oven, sprinkle cilantro over the top.  Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice over the top. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
