Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Add eggs and vanilla and beat until combined. Beat in the vanilla, followed by the soda and salt – make sure there are no lumps of stray soda. Stir in the cake flour, then stir in the all purpose flour, followed by the chopped nuts.Chill the dough for about an hour.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a couple of cookie sheets with parchment if you want.Shape dough into large balls (golf ball size) – a little smaller) and place cookie sheets. The cookies spread a bit, so leave room between the balls. Bake for 13 – 15 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. The centers may seem a bit underdone at this point, but they will firm up. Let cookies cool on the pan 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cream butter, shortening (or lard), peanut butter, and both sugars together in a mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":16098,"name":"peanut butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peanut-butter.jpg"},{"id":4615,"name":"shortening","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add eggs and vanilla and beat until combined.
