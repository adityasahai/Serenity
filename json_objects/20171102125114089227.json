A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Generously butter a 9 inch pie dish, set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring water, butter and salt to a boil. Once mixture reaches a boil, reduce heat to low and stir in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes together forming a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat and while stirring, add in eggs one at a time mixing until well combine after each addition. Using buttered hands, spread mixture into an even layer over the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pie dish. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes until golden brown. Cool pie shell completely. Meanwhile (you can do this while the pie shell bakes), prepare chocolate sauce by combining semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave chocolate mixture on 50% power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until melted and smooth. Cool completely (it needs to be cool or it will melt the whipped cream, you can chill it in the fridge while the pie shell bakes and cools, then reheat it slightly in the microwave on HIGH power in 5 second intervals, stirring after each interval until desired consistency is reached).In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup heavy cream, milk and pudding mix, for about 3 minutes until mixture has thickened. Spread pastry cream into an even layer over cooled puff pastry pie shell (note that it's pretty much inevitable that you're going to have some bubbles in the pie shell, you can try and flatten them a bit before spreading in the filling).In a large mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whip 3/4 cup heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add in granulated sugar and whip until stiff peaks form. Spread sweetened whipped cream evenly over pastry cream layer.Cut pie into slices and drizzle each slice with cooled chocolate sauce. Serve immediately. Note: this pie is best served the day prepared. Also note, the sweetened whipped cream will begin to separate after about 3 hours so plan accordingly.
