A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Divide the mixture equally into each cup in the pan and press down. Bake for 7 minutes. **Reduce heat to 300 F degrees.Add the cream cheese and brown sugar to the bowl of your mixer and mix until smooth for about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and continue mixing.Add the sour cream, instant coffee, salt, vanilla extract, cocoa powder and melted chocolate to the mixer and mix until smooth. Do not over mix since over mixing can cause the cheesecakes to crack.Spoon cheesecake batter into each cup and fill to the top. There should be enough batter for all 12 cups. If you have any leftover batter, I usually just bake it in little ramekins, makes for a great dessert.Bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cheesecakes cool completely before removing them from the pan. Refrigerate the cheesecakes for a couple hours so that they set properly.Top each cheesecake with cool whip. I used a piping bag to pipe the cool whip easier. You could also use a plastic bag instead of a piping bag. Top the cheesecakes with a strawberry then pipe a bit of cool whip on each strawberry tip.Refrigerate until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 F degrees.In a bowl mix together the oreo cookie crumbs with the butter.
