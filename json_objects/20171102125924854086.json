Add remaining yogurt and remaining dry ingredients, mixing just until combined.Fold in poppy seeds and dried cranberries by hand.Pour batter into 12 greased muffin cups. Cups will be very full, almost to the point of overflowing (it’s okay!).Bake muffins in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow to cool in pan for about 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Muffins can be stored in the fridge or the freezer.
