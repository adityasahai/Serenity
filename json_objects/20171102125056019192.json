When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on either side of the charcoal grate and place a foil pan between the two piles of coals. Cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Run spit of the rotisserie through middle of pork roll and secure ends with rotisserie forks. Place on the rotisserie, cover, and cook at medium heat until skin has darkened and crisped and pork registers 155ºF when an instant read thermometer is inserted into the thickest part of the meat, about 3 hours, replenishing coals to maintain temperature as needed. Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove spit, slice, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"To make the brine: In a large bowl, whisk together water, salt, and sugar until solids are dissolved.
