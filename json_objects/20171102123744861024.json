Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444296,"title":"Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio","description":"The 2012 wine is deep straw-yellow in color.
