and Verdicchio are great choices for Pastan E Fagioli. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Prepare ingredients as indicated.Heat 1 Tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.Add mushrooms, onion, celery, carrot and garlic to pot and cook for about 5 minutes or until vegetables are softened.Add remaining ingredients to the pot and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes.Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes more.Top with cheese, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare ingredients as indicated.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat 1 Tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add mushrooms, onion, celery, carrot and garlic to pot and cook for about 5 minutes or until vegetables are softened.","ingredients":[{"id":11260,"name":"mushrooms","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mushrooms.jpg"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add remaining ingredients to the pot and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes.Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes more.Top with cheese, if desired.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
