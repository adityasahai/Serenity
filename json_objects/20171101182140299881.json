Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 43 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Pour tequila, simple syrup and grapefruit juice in champagne glass and stir gently to combine.Add chilled sparkling wine and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour tequila, simple syrup and grapefruit juice in champagne glass and stir gently to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":98926,"name":"grapefruit juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/grapefruit-juice.jpg"},{"id":90480,"name":"simple syrup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-syrup.jpg"},{"id":10043155,"name":"champagne","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/champagne.jpg"},{"id":10814037,"name":"tequila","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tequila.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add chilled sparkling wine and serve immediately.","ingredients":[{"id":43155,"name":"sparkling wine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/champagne.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
