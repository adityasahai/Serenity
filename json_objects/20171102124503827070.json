Use your left hand to drop oneoysterinto the flour. Use your right hand to gently cover theoysterin flour. (NOTE: The goal is to keep your right hand dry and your left hand wet or you will end up breading your fingers and not theoyster.) Use your dry hand to place the flour-dustedoysterinto the bowl of eggs. Use your wet hand to thoroughly coat theoysterin egg and then place it into the breadcrumbs. Use your dry hand to thoroughly coat theoysterin breadcrumbs and gently press the breadcrumbs onto theoyster. Place the breadedoysteron a plate and refrigerate until ready to fry. Repeat this process with eachoyster.  For prep:   Drain the excess liquid from the jar of kimchi and cut the kimchi into less than bite-size pieces. Combine the mayonnaise and sesame oil and set aside.   For assembly:  Lightly brush the cut side of the slider buns with melted butter and toast in a dry pan over medium heat. Fry the breadedoystersin 350 degree oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Spread the sesame mayo on the bottom half of the toasted bun, sprinkle with chopped cilantro and peanuts, place a pinch of kimchi on top of the cilantro and peanuts and follow with a few slices of pickled jalapeo. Place the friedoysterand the top of the bun on the sliders and serve immediately.
