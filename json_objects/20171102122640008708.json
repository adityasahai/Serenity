Add the rice and cook, stirring, until the grains turn from pale white to bright white, 5 to 7 minutes.                          Carefully pour the simmering broth mixture over the rice and vermicelli. Scrape down the sides of the pan, making sure that all of the rice is submerged in broth.

Add the parsley and fluff the pilaf with a fork. Season with salt and pepper.
