Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
