are my top picks for Asian. The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. One wine you could try is Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented.
