Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":459422,"title":"Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia","description":"Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia is certainly the most representative wine of Cecchi. Produced only in years in which the grapes reach the quality desired it comes from the area of Castellina in Chianti. The color of excellent limpidity is of an intense ruby red. The aroma reveals broad and ethereal notes of ripe fruit and spices. The structure is elegant.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/459422-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-chianti-classico-riserva-di-famiglia-2014/240545"}]},"instructions":"Simmer the stock for 10 minutes with the asparagus trimmings and pea pods; these will intensify the flavour. Strain into a jug.While the stock is simmering, heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a wide, shallow pan. Tip in the onion and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, stirring, until it is soft but not coloured. Add the rice and continue to stir and cook for 1-2 minutes until the grains become see-through at the edges and begin to make ‘clicking’ noises.Add the wine (it should bubble and evaporate), then 50ml/2fl oz of the stock. Stir well and simmer gently until all the liquid has been absorbed. Now pour in another 50ml/2fl oz stock and stir again. Continue adding the stock and stirring. After about 7 minutes, when half the stock has been added, swirl in the asparagus and peas. Carry on adding stock in small amounts until it has been absorbed; this will take about 10 more minutes. Now the risotto should be a little wet and sloppy and the rice tender with a nutty bite.Turn off the heat, then gently stir in the grated Parmesan, taste and season. You may need only a little black pepper as the Parmesan and stock are both salty. Spoon the risotto on to a plate, top with the rocket, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and scatter with Parmesan shavings. Pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy your meal.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Simmer the stock for 10 minutes with the asparagus trimmings and pea pods; these will intensify the flavour.
