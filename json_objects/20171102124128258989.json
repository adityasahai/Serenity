Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431299,"title":"Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Luminous pear and apple notes animated with aromas of lime and lemon.","price":"$12.75","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431299-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2016-Proverb-Pinot-Grigio-750mL/dp/B074G3D221"}]},"instructions":"Fill a large pot with 4 quarts of water. Squeeze the lemon juice into the water and add the squeezed lemon halves. Add the Old Bay, garlic and onion. Tie the thyme sprigs together with kitchen twine and add to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook about 5 minutes.                          Add the potatoes to the pot and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn and cook 5 more minutes.                          Meanwhile, slice along the back of each shrimp through the shells; remove the veins and rinse the shrimp. Add to the pot, cover and cook until the shrimp curl and are just opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp and vegetables with a slotted spoon or skimmer to a large bowl. Add the butter and about 1 cup broth to the bowl and toss until the butter is melted. Transfer the shrimp and vegetables to a platter. Serve with the remaining broth, lemon wedges and hot sauce, if desired.
