Continue adding rabe and broth until all the rabe and the liquid is in the skillet. Add the pasta and stir to combine. Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat until the liquid is at a vigorous simmer. Allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the pasta is al dente or at desired consistency, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with grated or cubed cheese.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the shallots, a pinch of salt and the chili flakes and cook until softened, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":11677,"name":"shallot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"2","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Add 2 cups broccoli rabe and 2 cups of broth and cook, stirring until the rabe wilts enough to fit more into the pan.
