Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"In a small bowl whisk together sour cream, milk, lime juice, hot sauce, taco seasoning and salt. Cream should be thin enough to drizzle. Set aside. Heat a skillet to medium heat. Swirl the pan with canola oil. Pat the halibut dry with a paper towel. Season both sides generously with taco seasoning, salt and pepper. Place into hot skillet and cook until browned on both sides and cooked through, being careful not to overcook and dry out. Halibut is cooked when it flakes with a fork, but is still moist inside. Flake halibut apart in pan. Steam corn tortillas in a tortilla warmer or ziploc bag in microwave for 2 minutes.  Take two steamed corn tortillas and place some cooked halibut in the center. Top halibut with cabbage, and a generous amount of cilantro and green onion. Top with an avocado slice and drizzle with crema. Serve with salsa and lemon/lime wedges on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl whisk together sour cream, milk, lime juice, hot sauce, taco seasoning and salt.
