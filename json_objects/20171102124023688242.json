Do the same with the vanilla dough.Refrigerate both doughs on a sheet pan for 1 hour.Cut each block into desired size for checkering.  I cut the block into thirds, then into thirds again (see blog photos).Start alternating the pieces with chocolate and vanilla, then square it off and press together.
