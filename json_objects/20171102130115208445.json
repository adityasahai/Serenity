If you are using a tough cut of beef, the recipe will use both quarts of water and take 2  hours. If you are using a higher quality cut of beef, only one quart of water will be needed and the cooking time will be less. If you are not sure, save one quart of water and add it towards the end if too much liquid has evaporated. I suggest using a chuck roast as the meat of choice for beef stew.Mix flour, salt and pepper together in a bowl. Dredge beef cubes in flour and remove, shaking off excess flour.Over medium high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of oil in 6 quart heavy bottomed stock pot until slightly brown and frothy. Place half of the beef in the hot fat making sure that meat pieces do not touch each other. Cook 2 minutes then flip using metal tongs and cook 2 more minutes on the other side. Remove from pan and heat the other tablespoon of butter and oil then cook the second half of the meat. Remove meat from pan when done and set aside.Turn heat to medium and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add in chopped onions and cook about 2-3 minutes until tender. Add chopped garlic and cook for one more minute. Add tomato paste and cook for an additional minute.Add in red wine to deglaze pan, scraping up any brown bits from bottom.Add stock, water, bay leaf, thyme, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and sugar. Bring to a boil then turn heat down to a simmer and cover pot with lid slightly ajar. Simmer for 2  hours or until beef is tender, adjusting water as needed.Add in carrots, potatoes, green beans and pearl onions and simmer for 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender.While vegetables are cooking, prepare dumpling batter as follows: Sift flour, baking powder and sugar together. Add salt and thyme into the bowl and then cut in butter. Add milk and stir with spoon until mixed.Add green peas and chopped parsley to stew, adjust seasoning and turn heat to low.Once stew is finished, drop heaping tablespoons of dumpling batter into stew until all batter is used. Cover and cook ten minutes.Serve bowls of stew with dumplings on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Note: With this recipe, the type of meat used will determine your cooking time.
