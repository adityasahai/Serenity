Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Add the flour, whole eggs, egg yolks and olive oil to the bowl of a food processor. Mix to combine until the dough comes together in a ball. It should be soft but shouldn't stick to your fingers.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or parchment paper, shaping it into a 6 inch log. Set is aside at room temperature for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. America's Test Kitchen recommends letting the dough rest for 4 hours, so that's what I did.Divide the dough into 6 parts.On a lightly floured surface, take one piece of dough (leaving the rest of the dough wrapped in the plastic wrap, so it doesn't dry out) and with your fingers, pat the dough into about a 3 inch square.Roll out the dough into a 6 inch wide and 20 inch long sheet of dough. You should be able to see the outline of your hand when you hold it up. Try to use as little flour as possible when rolling it out. The dough is very easy to work with and is soft and pliable, so you shouldn't have any problems.Place the rolled out pasta sheet onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment, or your table surface, etc.Repeat with the other 5 pieces of dough. Place each rolled out sheets of dough in one layer to dry for about 15 minutes. Don't put them on top of each other or they will stick together.When the dough has dried for at least 15 minutes, roll in up starting with the short side, and use a sharp knife to cut across the rolled up pasta sheet, to get strands of pasta.For this recipe, I cut the pasta just slightly smaller than ¼ of an inch. You can also cut the pasta into thicker strands, or keep the pasta dough in sheets and use it for lasagna or make ravioli with it.Lightly unfurl the pasta with your fingers.You can freeze the pasta like this, by freezing it for about 20 minutes and then placing it into a ziptop bag or a sealed container.To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.While you are waiting for the water to boil, make your sauce. Homemade pasta cooks much quicker than the pasta from the box, so make sure your sauce is ready to add to the pasta before you start cooking it.Add the olive oil, garlic and anchovy paste (or minced anchovies) to a skillet.Cook the sauce on medium low heat until the garlic is lightly golden, whisking so that the anchovy paste is mixed into the oil. Off the heat, whisk in the lemon juice and the parsley.When the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook on high heat for about 3 minutes.Drain the pasta, saving about ½ a cup of the starchy water to thin out your sauce if you need to loosen the pasta a bit later.Add the sauce to the cooked pasta, gently tossing with tongs to evenly distribute the sauce. Add some of the reserved pasta water, to loosen the pasta a bit. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.You can garnish the pasta with finely grated Romano or Parmesan cheese, but it's so tasty with this light and aromatic sauce, it will be just as delicious with it or without it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the flour, whole eggs, egg yolks and olive oil to the bowl of a food processor.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"},{"id":1125,"name":"egg yolk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-yolk.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix to combine until the dough comes together in a ball.
