The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. One wine you could try is Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 9 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 Â°C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees.Work your pizza dough into a greased pan.
