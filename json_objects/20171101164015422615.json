Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Belasco de Baquedano Llama Malbec with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449922,"title":"Belasco de Baquedano Llama Malbec","description":"As its namesake, this wine embodies the distinctive spirit of our vineyards, spanning the foothills of the Andes.

Set aside.Preheat the oven to 350F (This is to toast the bagels all at once. If you prefer to use a toaster or a toaster oven you wont need to heat your conventional oven).Using your hands, combine the lean ground beef and pork sausage in a large bowl. Careful not to overmix (working it too much can give you tough burgers) but try to get the sausage well-incorporated. Form 8 small patties that are as close in size as you can make them.Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium high heat. Add as many of the patties as you can comfortably fit (I do 3 or 4 at a time). Sear each side for about a minute before turning.If you preheated the oven to toast the bagels you can put them in now. I like to split the bagels and put them face down directly on the rack.Continue cooking the burgers until the centers are cooked through (the sausage in the mixture means you wont want any pink; they will still be plenty juicy!), about a total of 4 minutes on each side. Add the cheese to each burger and remove them to a plate.Take the bagels out of the oven -- you want the face of each to be golden.In a nonstick skillet cook your eggs. This will be according to your preference. Pictured is a perfect over medium with the whites cooked completely through and the yolk only runny in the very center.Assemble your burgers -- spread the Maple Sriracha Aioli on both sides of each bagel. On the bottom bagel half stack your greens, an onion ring, and a couple of thin tomato slices. Then add the burger. Top it with the fried egg, half a slice of bacon, and then the top half of the bagel.Serve hot.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl mix together the mayonnaise, maple syrup, and sriracha sauce until smooth.
