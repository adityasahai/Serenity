A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Add the sour cream and the melted butter and mix well. Add the flour and the baking powder, and mix well.In another bowl mix the ricotta with the remainder of the sugar and the remaining 2 eggs and mix well. You may also add raisins with ricotta if you wish. Personally I like a few raisins in this cake, so now would be the time to add about 1/2 cup of raisins.You can use a cheesecake pan, butter it well. Pour the cake batter first, then pour the ricotta mix in the middle. Do not mix. Bake until golden brown. Let cool before serving. You may also sprinkle some powdered sugar on top of the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven at 375 F degrees.In a mixer, add 2 of the eggs and 1/2 cup of the sugar and mix well until light and fluffy.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the sour cream and the melted butter and mix well.","ingredients":[{"id":1056,"name":"sour cream","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sour-cream.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the flour and the baking powder, and mix well.In another bowl mix the ricotta with the remainder of the sugar and the remaining 2 eggs and mix well.
