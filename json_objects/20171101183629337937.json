After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon.

Then lay the steaks out on a plate and salt and pepper if cooking right away. If not cooking until the next day, do not season until then.In a large 12 inch skillet with a tight fitting lid over medium high heat, place one tablespoon of oil, all of the mushrooms and the salt. Stir, cover and cook for five minutes. The mushrooms will give up a lot of water. Remove cover and cook for 5-10 minutes until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms get dry and browned. Remove from heat and place in bottom of slow cooker.In same pan, heat remaining oil with onions, thyme and paprika. Cook uncovered for 8-10 minutes until lightly browned.Add flour and cook for one minute.Slowly add stock and sherry while whisking until combined.
