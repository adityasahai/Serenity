Insert a candy thermometer and let bubble (no stirring) until it reaches 250F. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in the coconut butter until smooth.Quickly scrape the coconut-honey mixture onto the dry ingredients and stir to thoroughly combine. Pour the mixture into your prepared dish, and using the greased measuring cup, firmly press it in until even. Let cool 30 minutes to 1 hour.Whisk the coconut butter, lemon juice and powdered sugar together in a small bowl until smooth. Add the turmeric, if using  it doesn't notably alter the flavor, so you can use an extra pinch if it isn't yellow enough for your liking.Cut the cooled bars as desired, into squares or skinny rectangles, and drizzle with the icing. If the icing firms up too quickly, heat it in the microwave for about 15 seconds and whisk.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grease or line a 9x9-inch baking dish with parchment paper (a 9x13-inch is okay, too, but will produce thinner bars).
