If possible, prepare it the night before, or up to a week before you are ready to use it. Set a food-strainer or a mesh sieve over a medium-sized bowl; set aside.Pour water into a saucepan; you will need enough water to cover the bottom of the saucepan and come 1-inch up the sides; bring water to a simmer. Place a heat-resistant bowl over the saucepan.Add eggs, sugar, and lemon juice to the bowl; whisk until blended.Continue to cook and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens; about 8 to 10 minutes.Remove from heat and pour the mixture through previously prepared strainer so to remove any lumps.Whisk butter into the mixture.Add the lemon zest and whisk to combine.Cover with plastic wrap; this will prevent skin formation on top of lemon curd. Let slightly cool.Refrigerate for 4 hours, or until thickened and cold. Preheat oven to 350.Set oven rack in the middle.Lightly grease 9-inch springform cake pan with baking spray and set aside.In a mixing bowl, whisk cake flour, baking powder and salt; whisk until combined.Set a small saucepan over medium-high heat and add milk and butter; bring to a boil.Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and lemon juice.In your mixer's bowl, combine eggs and sugar; beat until pale yellow and doubled in size.Mix in lemon zest.With the mixer on, slowly pour in the milk mixture; mix until well incorporated.Turn off mixer and gently fold in the flour mixture.Spread the batter in the prepared springform pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.Remove from oven and set pan on a cooling rack.Snap open the springform pan and turn out the cake; let completely cool.In a mixing bowl, combine whipping cream, vanilla, and sugar.Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.When chilled, beat the mixture until stiff peaks form.Spread Lemon Curd over the top of cooled cake.Pipe Vanilla Whipped Cream Frosting around the edges of the cake.Garnish with blueberries and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare Lemon Curd, first.
