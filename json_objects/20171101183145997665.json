pieces. Season well with Adobo.Heat a very large skillet or dutch oven with lid and 1 Tbsp. of the bacon grease or olive oil over medium high heat. Add as much chicken to the pan as possible without crowding and brown well on both sides. (2-3 minutes per side in my kitchen.) Remove chicken to a large plate and repeat as necessary until all the chicken is browned, adding more oil as necessary. (Chicken will still be pink in the middle. This is OK!)Add the carrot to the pan and cook for about 3 minutes or until the carrot begins to soften slightly, stirring often. Add the onion and cook for another 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional minute.Add the rice and chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is slightly translucent and is well mixed with the other ingredients, about 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes with their juices, the chicken stock, bay leves, turmeric. Stir well, cover the pan and allow to come to a simmer.Reduce heat to low and continue to simmer until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid; about 8 minutes.Arrange chicken on top of the rice and pour collected juices over the top. Cover the pan again and allow to simmer gently until the chicken is cook through, about 15 minutes.Remove the lid, sprinkle the peas and olives on top, cover and simmer for another 3 minutes.Stir well.
