Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts.

Grease or spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine orange zest and sugar in a small bowl. Cream the butter and cream cheese until well combined. Add the orange sugar, salt, and vanilla, and blend until ingredients are well combined, but not fluffy. Add the flour and mix just until incorporated.Fill each muffin cup with 1 tablespoon of cookie dough. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until edges are browned, the centers will not be completely set. Remove the cookies from the oven and using the end of a thick-handled wooden spoon make a small, deep well in the center of each cookie. Remove to a wire rack to cool.Cream Cheese Frosting: Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Add the powdered sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Pipe the frosting into the cookie cups (I used a ziploc bag with the tip cut off) or spoon it in. Drizzle with the melted chocolate. Put into the fridge until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 375ยบ.
