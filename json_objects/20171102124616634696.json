Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The MacMurray Ranch Russian River Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Reduce the heat to low and stir. Cover and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, 16 to 18 minutes.                          Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until golden brown, 5 minutes. Add the sazon and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water; cook, stirring, until absorbed. Add the tofu and scallions to the rice; fluff with a fork.                          Wrap the tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave 30 seconds. Sprinkle the bottom halves with the cheese; top with the tofu mixture, pico de gallo and lettuce. Fold the bottom edge over the filling, fold in the sides, then roll up tightly. Arrange seam-side down on a large microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel.
