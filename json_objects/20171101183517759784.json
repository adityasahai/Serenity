Line an 11X7\" baking pan with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of paper hanging on the sides. In a microwave safe bowl or a small saucepan, melt the butter. With a hand whisk, stir in the sugar and vanilla extract. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.Gently, fold in the flour, cocoa, graham cracker crumbs,baking powder and salt. Stir until just blended. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, top with the marshmallows, chocolate chips and the remaining graham cracker crumbs and place until the broiler for few more minutes. Keep an eye on it since the marshmallows will easily burn. Once toasted, remove from the oven and let cool completely. To cut into bars, use a very sharp knife and have a wet towel close by. Clean the knife's blade after each cut. Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oven to 350F.
