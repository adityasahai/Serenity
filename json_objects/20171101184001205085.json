Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage. Consider it with nuts before dinner as an aperitif, or after dinner with dessert, especially chocolates and fruit-based desserts. Also wonderful on cold afternoons, served with biscotti to dip in \"\"Italian-style\"\". \"","price":"$19.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430626-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Johnson-Estate-Cream-Sherry-750/dp/B00D3GQSRW"}]},"instructions":"Combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir until everything is well incorporated and starting to stick together. Stick the bowl in the refrigerator for 10 minutes, or until the nut mixture has chilled and firmed up slightly. With damp hands, form 1 tablespoon of dough into a ball, squeezing it until about 1-inch wide and very compact. (I found it helpful to have a bowl of water handy since the mixture can get sticky and it's easier to have wet hands when handling). Continue with the remaining nut mixture, reserving the balls on a plate or parchment lined sheet pan. Chill the cookie bites until ready to serve or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator to snack on throughout the week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir until everything is well incorporated and starting to stick together.
