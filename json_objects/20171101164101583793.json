Butter six 4-ounce ramekins or 6-ounce custard cups. Place them on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).2. In a large heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water, heat the 5 ounces chopped chocolate and the milk until the chocolate melts. Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the simmering water. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in 3 tablespoons sugar, the whiskey, and the egg yolks. Let cool to room temperature.3. In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until they’re foamy and begin to hold their shape as peaks when the beaters are lifted. Gradually beat in the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, whipping until the whites form and hold soft, droopy peaks.4. Using a spatula, gently fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Fill each ramekin or custard cup halfway with the soufflé mixture. Sprinkle with the coarsely chopped chocolate or chocolate chips. Add enough of the remaining batter to fill each soufflé dish almost to the top.5. Bake for 14 minutes, or until the soufflés appear firm yet are slightly jiggly when nudged. They should be very soft when you remove them from the oven. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Butter six 4-ounce ramekins or 6-ounce custard cups.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404781,"name":"ramekin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/ramekin.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place them on a baking sheet.
