After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Rombauer Merlot. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":447938,"title":"Rombauer Merlot","description":"Enticing and lively red color; beautifully aromatic with black cherry and ripe plum. On the palate a purity of blackcurrant, cedar and mint flavors blend together seamlessly.
