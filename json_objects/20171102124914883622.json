Remove steaks and caps from the pan and cover with loose foil tent to keep warm and let juices distribute. Add butter and flour to the pan and whisk in wine. Scrape up drippings, reduce wine for half a minute, then whisk in a little beef stock. Thicken sauce another half minute, then remove from heat.
