White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Cover or seal and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.                          Pour 1/2 to 1 inch of oil into a deep 12-inch cast-iron skillet and heat until a pinch of flour sizzles upon contact (about 360 degrees F). Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and set aside. In a bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs. Place the flour in a separate bowl. Dip the chicken in the egg wash, drain off the excess, then dredge in the flour, shaking off the excess.                          Working in batches, place the chicken skin-side down in the skillet and fry for 3 minutes without moving. Continue to fry, turning the chicken every 1 to 2 minutes to ensure even browning and cooking, until the chicken is cooked through, 11 to 15 minutes. Drain on the rack and serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
