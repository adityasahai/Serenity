Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add theflour, cornstarch,baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Add the pretzels (I add them whole and let the mixer crush them, or you cancrush them in your fist over the mixing bowl before adding if you prefer tinier pieces), chocolate chips, and beat on low speed until just combinedor pretzels are as small as desired,about 1 minute. Using alarge cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form 10 equal-sized mounds of dough (they look fairlylarge because the pretzels are bulky), roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip - Strategically place a few chocolate chips and pretzels on top of each mound of dough by taking chips and pretzels from the underside; shield large pretzel pieces on the undersides of dough mounds so pretzels aren't resting directly on the baking sheet because they'll be prone to burning. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 3 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with aSilpator spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet)and bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.
