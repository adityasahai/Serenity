In a medium sauce pot combine the orange juice, balsamic vinegar, honey, tomato paste, minced chipotle chiles + 1 tablespoon of the adobo sauce, cumin, olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer 10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened, reduced and become syrup like. Remove from the heat and allow to cool 5-10 minutes. Pour about 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of the sauce over the chicken and give it a good toss (reserve the remaining sauce for serving). Place the chicken in the fridge for 20 minutes or up to overnight.To make the rice: Place the rice in a pot. Cover with chicken broth (or water) and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 30-40 minutes. Fluff with a fork.Meanwhile heat a little extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high to high heat. Grab the chicken and when the oil is hot, add the chicken and brown for 5-8 minutes, then turn and brush with a little more of the remaining sauce. Cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat and let sit five minutes, slice the chicken into strips.To make the dressing: In a small bowl or glass jar combine the olive oil, lime juice, balsamic vinegar, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. Whisk well, taste and season to your liking.To assembles the bowls place some lettuce in each bowl, if desired toss the greens with a little dressing. Top each bowl with equal amounts of sliced oranges, grape tomatoes, sliced avocados, cilantro and green onions. Add the rice and chicken. Sprinkle with cashews and feta. Eat warm drizzled with more dressing and any remaining chipotle orange sauce if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the chicken in a glass baking dish.
