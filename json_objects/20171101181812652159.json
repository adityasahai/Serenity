Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.
