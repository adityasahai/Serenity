The term “minute steak” has two different meanings for kosher and non-kosher butchers. Traditional minute steak is a non-kosher cut that is tenderized and will cook quickly. A kosher minute steak is a different cut, known as a flat iron blade steak; it also cooks quickly. Both kosher and non-kosher minute steaks may be used in this recipe. Charcoal chuck steak (boneless) may also be used. The most important thing with all cuts is to slice the meat very thin against the grain, and trim away any excess fat.Cut beef across the grain in very thin 2-inch strips, trimming excess fat from the meat as you go. Put the beef in a bowl and sprinkle with baking soda. Work the baking soda into the meat with clean fingers, mixing it to coat all pieces of meat evenly. Let the meat sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp dry sherry or orange juice, 1 tbsp cornstarch, ½ tsp garlic powder, pinch of cayenne (use a large pinch for more heat), and 1 tbsp of grapeseed or peanut oil. Rinse the meat thoroughly and pat dry. Pour the marinade over the meat and stir till the meat is well coated. Let the beef marinate for 10-15 minutes.While meat is marinating, place the broccoli florets in a saucepan with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Cover with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and steam the broccoli for 7-8 minutes till tender, but not overly soft. Drain broccoli immediately and spray with cold water to cool. Shake off excess water and set aside.Whisk together 3 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp cornstarch, 2 tbsp brown sugar, ¼ cup water, 2 tbsp orange juice and 1 tsp fresh minced ginger. Reserve.Heat up a wok or large skillet over medium high till hot. The skillet is ready to fry when a drop of water sizzles on the surface. Pour in 2 tbsp of peanut or grapeseed oil and swirl it around, coating the edges. Pour the beef into the skillet or wok and spread it out across the oiled surface in an even layer. Let the meat fry undisturbed for 1 minute. Stir and continue to fry for 2 minutes longer till the beef turns brown. Scoop out the meat and place it on a plate. You should have some oil and fat left in the wok or skillet, but if it seems dry you can add a little more oil. Add the steamed broccoli and stir fry for 1-2 minutes.Add the beef and the reserved sauce. Stir fry for 2 minutes longer, till the sauce thickens.Serve hot over steamed rice or quinoa, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Kosher Meat Note: Kosher top sirloin is pricey and difficult to find, so if you’re keeping kosher, you can also use boneless ribeye steak or minute steak.
