A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Stir just until combine. Pour half the cake mix in bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch pan and spread evenly.Prepare the streusel by combing all dry ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl: brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Add butter and microwave for 30-60 seconds until butter is melted. Stir melted butter into dry ingredients. Sprinkle half the streusel mixture over the bottom of the pan and gently swirl with a knife. Pour remaining cake batter on top and sprinkle with remaining streusel.Bake cake for 24-28 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, your cake is done. Remove from oven and allow cooling for 10 minutes.Prepare apple pie filling (recipe below)While the cake is still warm, take the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes all over the top of your cake. Allow to cool for another 20 minutes.Pour remaining jar of caramel sauce over the cake and top with apple pie filling (recipe listed below).Put your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer to help it get very cold. This is optional, but something I usually do.Beat heavy whipping cream on medium-high speed. Slowly added powdered sugar, increasing speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form. Spread over cooled cake.Sprinkle with toffee bits and drizzle with caramel if desired.Slice apples into small pieces and squeeze a lemon over top and stir to combine.Add brown sugar, flour, maple syrup and cinnamon over top of apples. Stir to mix ingredients.Heat apples on the stove over medium heat for 15-20 minutes until soft. Stir occasionally. You want the apples to be soft. Set aside and allow to cool, refrigerating if necessary.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F.Prepare cake by combining cake mix with brown sugar, milk, vegetable oil, eggs, sour cream, caramel and cinnamon.
