Dump the granola mixture onto the parchment lined baking sheet and shape it into a large rectangle that's about 9x13 inches, and about 1 inch thick.

Cool the granola on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, then cut into small bars with a really sharp knife.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
