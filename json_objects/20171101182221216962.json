Heat over medium-high heat until simmering. Simmer for 9-12 minutes, or until pasta is tender.

Set aside.Once noodles are tender, add milk mixture.  Stir and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.Remove from heat, and add cheese, one handful at a time.  Stir to combine after each addition.If you need additional liquid at this point, you can add a bit of water or milk/half and half to reach desired consistency.
