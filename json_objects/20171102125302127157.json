After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 58 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435309,"title":"Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot","description":"This wine shows aromas of sweet plum sauce, vanilla, chocolate, cedar and butterscotch with big, forward black cherry and black berry fruit in the mouth. A balanced middle with a hint of toasty oak is paired with a nice bite from rounded tannins, and a long pleasant finish. This wine pairs well with grilled meats and wild game with herb-infused, wild-berry sauces, hearty pasta dishes and Pacific Northwest Salmon.","price":"$57.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435309-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/duckhorn-napa-valley-merlot-1995/26649"}]},"instructions":"Heat about ¼ to ½ inch of oil in a large frying pan (cast iron preferred) over medium high heat to a consistent temp of about 365 to 375.
