Spray a muffin pan with cooking spray. Now, measure out the spinach into a microwave-safe bowl and thaw it in the microwave for 1 - 2 minutes ... it should break apart easily but not be too hot. Push a clean kitchen towel down on top of the spinach to soak up the excess water out of it. (Then put the towel in the laundry.)Separate the eggs into two small mixing bowls: yolks in one, the whites in the other. To the bowl with the yolks, add the spinach, bacon, quinoa, cheese, seasonings and garlic and stir. Get your electric mixer out and beat up the egg whites until when you stop the blender and pull it out of the egg whites, it makes stiff peaks that don't soften as they stand. Sprinkle the cream of tartar over the egg whites, then beat a little longer.Fold the egg white mixture into the spinach mixture.until it's pretty well mixed, making sure to scoop up the spinach on the bottom so it gets incorporated. Be gentle. You should have this puffy mixture with lots of pretty green flecks in it.Divide the puffy egg mixture amongst the holes in the muffin tin. It's okay to fill them all the way to the top. Sprinkle with a few bits of cooked bacon and shredded cheese if you like. Bake at 350 for 15 - 18 minutes or until the tops are a nice golden brown.Let the cups sit a few minutes, then they are ready to eat! You can also make them ahead of time and reheat them or serve them at room temperature. Make sure to store them in an airtight container in the fridge.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 F. Spray a muffin pan with cooking spray.
