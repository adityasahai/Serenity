Heat in the microwave for 60 seconds. Remove an immediately whisk until smooth.Allow to sit for 10-15 minutes until cool or refrigerate to cool off.Place mixing bowl and wire whisk attachment in the freezer for 5-10 minutes until bowl is cold. Pour 1 cups heavy whipping cream into chilled bow. Beat heavy whipping cream on medium-high speed for 2 minutes until cream becomes bubbly. Slowly add powdered sugar and increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form (3-5 minutes). Measure out  cup of whipped cream for the topping. Set remaining aside.In a separate mixing bowl, beat cream cheese on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.Next, add melted chocolate mixture and beat until mixture is smooth.Add no-taste red food coloring gel about 1 teaspoon at a time, and fold into mixture until desired red color is reach. I would suggest a darker red as opposed to a nice bright red. This requires less food coloring.Gently fold prepared whipped cream (all but  cup) into the cream cheese mixture.Refrigerate cheesecake for about one hour until slightly firm.To assemble the parfaits:Use a food processor to grind up Oreos into a fine crumb.In a microwave-safe bowl, melt butter for about 30 seconds.Combine melted butter with Oreo cookie crumbs and mix thoroughly.Assemble your parfaits by adding two tablespoons of the Oreo crumbs into the bottom of your parfaits. Follow with about  cup of the chocolate filling and top with remaining prepared whipped cream right before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a microwave-proof bowl, place dark chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons heavy cream.","ingredients":[{"id":10019071,"name":"dark chocolate chips","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chocolate-chips.jpg"},{"id":1053,"name":"heavy cream","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat in the microwave for 60 seconds.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/microwave.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove an immediately whisk until smooth.Allow to sit for 10-15 minutes until cool or refrigerate to cool off.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Place mixing bowl and wire whisk attachment in the freezer for 5-10 minutes until bowl is cold.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Pour 1 cups heavy whipping cream into chilled bow.
