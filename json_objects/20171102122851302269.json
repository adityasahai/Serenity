You could probably half this recipe and bake it in a 9X13 pan. Cool for 15 minutes and spread with frosting.For the Frosting: Blend powdered sugar, butter, and cocoa along with enough milk to make the frosting a spreadable consistency. You do not want to add more than 1/2 cup of milk or your frosting will be too wet. You want a thick frosting that's barely spreadable. Spread over the brownies after they had cooled for 15 minutes. Keep spreading as the frosting melts making it even on the brownies. Allow brownies to continue to cool. Makes 30 good sized brownies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Beat eggs with a mixer in a large bowl.
