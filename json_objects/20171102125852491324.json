are my top picks for Scone. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry.

Use your rolling pin and roll the dough out to a half-inch thick. Use a 3-inch round cutter and cut as many circles of dough you can. Use the scraps to make more scones.Whisk together one whole egg and two tablespoons whole milk to make the egg wash.Brush with the egg wash and bake for 15-18 minutes or until the tops are golden, rotate the pan halfway through baking.
