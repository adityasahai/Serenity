After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Osprey's Dominion Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430916,"title":"Osprey's Dominion Merlot","description":"Osprey's Dominion Merlot offers classic dark plum aromas with blackberry preserves, sweet cedar, smoke and vanilla. And while the nose is rather fruity, the palate isn't overly so with rich flavors of chocolate, mint and tobacco joining the party. The medium tannins are there, but not overly aggressive. With another year or so in bottle they should integrate even more. Overall, this wine is medium on body but full on flavor","price":"$18.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430916-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2012-Ospreys-Dominion-Merlot-750/dp/B00GMP1JDY"}]},"instructions":"Place steak in a medium bowl and sprinkle with flour; turn to coat. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the steak (reserving excess flour) and cook, stirring once or twice, until browned on most sides and still pink in the center, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.Add mushrooms, onions and tomatoes to the pan and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the reserved flour over the vegetables; stir to coat. Add green beans, broth, wine, thyme, salt and pepper; increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until the broth has thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the steak and any accumulated juices and cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 2 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place steak in a medium bowl and sprinkle with flour; turn to coat.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the steak (reserving excess flour) and cook, stirring once or twice, until browned on most sides and still pink in the center, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add mushrooms, onions and tomatoes to the pan and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 3 minutes.
