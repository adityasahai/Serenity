While first layer cools, prepare filling.Unwrap caramels (ack! Why don’t they make unwrapped caramels!) and put them in a saucepan with the 1/3 cup of cream. Heat on medium low, stirring often, until caramels are melted. Stir about half of the chopped pecans into the caramel. Pour the caramel mixture over the brownie layer.Spread the remaining brownie mix over the caramel filling. It is kind of tricky, so do your best, but don’t worry about covering all the caramel. Scatter chocolate chips and remaining pecans over the top.Bake at 350 degrees for another 20 minutes or until the top batter appears set but not dry. Allow brownies to cool completely (this should take a few hours). I like to cool them and then chill them because it makes slicing easier.Lift brownies from pan and place on a big cutting board. Slice into whatever size you feel like.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a 13×9 inch pan with nonstick foil or parchment paper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute.
