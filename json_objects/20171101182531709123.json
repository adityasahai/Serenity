Add the warm water and mix well. Add the oil and honey (or sugar) and mix again. Cover the bowl and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Add the salt and start the mixer (or mix by hand), adding the remaining flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl to form a soft dough. You may not need to add all of the flour! Judge the dough by feel not by the amount of flour you've used. It might be slightly sticky but should hold it's shape. Let the dough knead for 7 minutes in the stand mixer (or 15 minutes by hand). Form into 5 loaves (for the 8 1/2 X 4-inch loaf pans) and place into greased bread pans. Let rise until the bread is 2 inches above the top of the bread pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes (I like to let the bread rise 1 inch above the top of the pans and then put the bread in a cold oven and turn the oven on to 350 degrees and bake the bread for 32 minutes).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl (or stand mixer, like the almighty Bosch), mix together 5 cups of wheat flour, yeast, vital wheat gluten and Vitamin C.","ingredients":[{"id":48052,"name":"vital wheat gluten","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/onion-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"wheat flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the warm water and mix well.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the oil and honey (or sugar) and mix again.
