Add butter and then pulse, about 15-17 times until dough starts to come together. If needed, add a tablespoon of two of ice water to bind the dough. Gather the dough into a ball and then flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in freezer for about 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts and press each dough ball into bottom and up the sides of a 4 1/2-inch-diameter tartlet pan with removable bottom. Pierce the crust all over with a fork (about 5-7 times). Repeat with remaining dough and then freeze tartlets for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 and bake crusts until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool crusts in pans on wire rack.Combine rapadura and 1/4 cup water in medium saucepan. Heat over medium-low until rapadura dissolves. Increase the heat to high and boil for 2-3 minutes, occasionally swirling pan. Remove pan from heat and add cream, butter and salt. Stir until completely dissolved. Set aside. (can be made a day ahead and kept in refrigerator. Rewarm over low heat until pourable before using).Blend flour, rapadura and salt in food processor. Add pecans and pulse, about 4-5 times until coarsely chopped. Add butter and pulse until moist clumps for (about 8 times).Stir together flour and arrowroot in a small bowl.
