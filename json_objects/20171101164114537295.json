Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E"}]},"instructions":"Chop all your salsa ingredients, toss all ingredients together in a bowl, then place in refrigerator.Heat up a medium skillet over medium heat and add your coconut milk, coconut aminos, fish sauce, fresh ginger and orange zest.Once the coconut milk begins to slightly bubble, add your salmon filets to the sauce.Cook salmon for about 2-4 minutes per side or until cooked to preference.Plate salmon then top with salsa, making sure some of the coconut milk makes it over the salmon!Boom sauce!!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Chop all your salsa ingredients, toss all ingredients together in a bowl, then place in refrigerator.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat up a medium skillet over medium heat and add your coconut milk, coconut aminos, fish sauce, fresh ginger and orange zest.Once the coconut milk begins to slightly bubble, add your salmon filets to the sauce.Cook salmon for about 2-4 minutes per side or until cooked to preference.Plate salmon then top with salsa, making sure some of the coconut milk makes it over the salmon!Boom sauce!!","ingredients":[{"id":98929,"name":"coconut aminos","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":15076,"name":"salmon fillets","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salmon.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"fresh ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"},{"id":9216,"name":"orange zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-orange.jpg"},{"id":6179,"name":"fish sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/asian-fish-sauce.jpg"},{"id":15076,"name":"salmon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salmon.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
