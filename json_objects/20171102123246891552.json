Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

In a large mixing bowl, mix peanut butter, brown sugar, egg, baking soda and vanilla until well combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Use a small cookie scoop, drop rounds 2 inches apart onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Use the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar to flatten the cookies slightly.
