I prefer to bake mine on a wire rack at 350 degrees F. for about 20 minutes until it's very crispy. 2) You can also make croutons at the same time by tossing some bread cubes with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast those while the bacon is crisping until they are lightly browned. They will continue to crisp up as they cool.3) For the dressing, stir together sour cream with buttermilk. Season with salt and pepper and fold in 3-4 ounces of crumbled blue cheese. Feel free to adjust the consistency of the dressing to your liking. Some like it thicker or thinner.4) Assemble each salad by chopping a big head of iceberg into quarters. Pull apart the lettuce a bit and drizzle each quarter with dressing. Top with crumbled bacon, croutons, cranberries, scallions, avocado, and extra blue cheese. That's just the start of topping options. Go crazy.","analyzedInstructions":[]}]}
