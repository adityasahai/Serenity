Remove the foil and continue baking for another 10-20 minutes or until you can poke a knife through the apple with no resistance.Serve warm with a dollop of Greek yogurt, whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Slice a thin layer off the top of each apple (this is to create a flat surface to hold more of the topping) and core, leaving about a half inch of the bottom in tact.
