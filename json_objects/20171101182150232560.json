Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439141,"title":"Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio","description":"It has a straw yellow color.
