Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper (or use silicone baking mats/Silpats). Pour the 1/2 cup sugar into a bowl and set aside (note that you probably won't use it all).2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder and baking soda together in a small bowl. Set aside.3. In another small bowl whisk together the golden syrup, egg white and vanilla. Set aside.4. In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle, beat butter with dark brown sugar and the additional 1/3 cup of organic sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes). Add the golden syrup mixture and beat until combined (about 1 minute). Add the flour mixture and chopped chocolate and mix until just combined (30 seconds-1 minute), making sure all of the flour is incorporated into the dough. 5. Chill dough for at least 30 minutes, or as long as overnight. Roll into approximately 16 equal sized balls with your hands, then roll these in sugar to coat. 6. Place on prepared baking sheets, approximately 2 inches apart. Bake 10-11 minutes, watching that the bottoms do not burn.7. The cookies are done when they have \"cracked\" and still look wet/underdone between the cracks..they will finish baking out of the oven.8. Allow the cookies to cool for a minute or two on the cookie sheets, then transfer to  cool fully on a wire rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
