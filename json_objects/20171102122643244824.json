Try pairing with Sparkling Wine. Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. One wine you could try is Billecart-Salmon Brut rosé ( Magnum). It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 170 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":457927,"title":"Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose ( Magnum)","description":"Persistent mousse, with fine bubbles rising slowly.
