Cut bread in half on the diagonal to get somewhat triangular pieces. Place half the bread decoratively in the bottom of the prepared pan, nestling and trimming to fit as necessary. Its OK if there are spaces between the slices. Spread berries over the bread. Cover with the remaining bread, trimming to fit as necessary.Whisk eggs, egg whites, milk, half-and-half, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Whisk in honey until completely incorporated. Pour the mixture over the bread. Let stand for 1 hour to allow the bread to soak up the liquid, pressing the bread down into the liquid a few times to help it absorb more. (Alternatively, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 12 hours, pressing on the bread a few times while it sits.)Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 350F. (If the pudding was refrigerated, remove the plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature while the oven preheats.) Cover the pan loosely with foil and set it on a rimmed baking sheet.Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbling and the pudding is just set, about 1 hour more. Let stand about 10 minutes before serving (most of the liquid will be absorbed by the bread as the pudding rests). Serve dusted with confectioners sugar, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut bread in half on the diagonal to get somewhat triangular pieces.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place half the bread decoratively in the bottom of the prepared pan, nestling and trimming to fit as necessary.
