Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/fonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998/12434"}]},"instructions":"Pour the olive oil into a large saucepot and place over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots, and basil and saute for 10-12 minutes, stirring regularly.Open the cans of stewed tomatoes. Pour the juices into the pot, then squash each tomato by hand, breaking into irregular pieces, as you place them into the pot. Add the bay leaf, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, vegetable broth, wine and bread. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 20-30 minutes. Stir occasionally.Check the pappa al pomodoro. If the bread cubes haven't dissolved creating a thick porridge, use a potato masher to break them up into smaller pieces.
