Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Ricasoli Castello di Brolio Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Add enough water to get the consistency to a thick batter. Dip ravioli into this batter and let excess drip off, then dip into brad crumbs to coat. Fry ravioli in hot (350 degrees) for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Top each ravioli with 1/2 slice of Provolone cheese. Place in oven under the broiling setting until the cheese melts.
