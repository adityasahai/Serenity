Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently.  Once butter melts and begins to foam, continue to cook until brown specks begin to appear beneath the foam.  Butter will have a nutty aroma.  Remove from heat and transfer to a glass bowl.  Allow to cool.Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.Beat cooled butter, brown sugar, and sugar until combined.  Add egg and vanilla, and mix well.  Gradually add flour mixture, mixing just until combined.Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 350.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners.Using about a tablespoonful of dough, roll into balls and place on prepared pans.  Flatten each ball slightly.  Sprinkle coarse salt on tops of cookies.  (The amount of salt is a preference thing.  I recommend just barely a pinch.)Bake 12-15 minutes, or until edges of cookies are browned and centers are set.  Cool in pans on wire racks for 5-10 minutes.  Then, transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place butter in a medium saucepan.
