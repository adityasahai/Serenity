Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé are great choices for Salsa. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 48 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":465202,"title":"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The Santa Lucia Highlands are known as one of the premier Pinot Noir appellations of the world. One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011/131978"}]},"instructions":"1. For the Firm-Cooked Black Beans: In a large, heavy stockpot, soak the beans in cold water to cover by at least 3 inches for no less than 4 hours, or overnight.2. Add the vegetables, garlic, bouquet garni, cumin and oregano to the pot of beans and soaking water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.3. Reduce the heat and gently simmer the beans, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Add water as necessary to keep the beans submerged.4. Season the beans with salt and pepper during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Drain the beans in a colander and rinse with cold water. Remove and discard the vegetables and bouquet garni. The beans are now ready to be used in the salsa, or they can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.5. Assemble the Salsa: Combine all of the ingredients for the salsa in a mixing bowl and toss well. Add more salt or lime juice as needed. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips.Note #1: If you do not have cheesecloth for the bouquet garni, you can also use a coffee filter.Note #2: If you prefer to not cook the beans yourself, you can use 2 cups of canned (rinsed and drained) black beans. If you do this, be sure to taste for seasoning adjustments. You will likely need to use more cumin, salt and pepper.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Firm-Cooked Black Beans: In a large, heavy stockpot, soak the beans in cold water to cover by at least 3 inches for no less than 4 hours, or overnight.2.","ingredients":[{"id":16015,"name":"black beans","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-beans.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the vegetables, garlic, bouquet garni, cumin and oregano to the pot of beans and soaking water.
