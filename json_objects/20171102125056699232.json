Blanc are great choices for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together masa flour, salt, chili powder, and baking powder. Add vegetable oil and chicken broth, and mixon low until combined. Use mixer on medium speed to mix dough for approximately 10 minutes. This beats air into the dough to give it a lighter texture. If you do not have a mixer, stir it as long as you can by hand, and then let the dough rest for at least 10 minutes.While the dough mixes, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced onions, and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add garlic, and cook another minute or two.Sprinkle both sides of chicken thighs lightly with salt and chili powder. Cook them about two minutes per side with the onions. Then, pour the tomato sauce, beans, cumin, and hot sauce over the chicken. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.While chicken simmers, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a large pie pan or square baking dish with cooking spray. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. (The dough will be spongy and easy to work with.)When chicken is done, shred meat with two forks, and stir back into the sauce. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the chicken filling into the prepared masa shell, leaving as much liquid behind in the skillet as possible.Spread cheese over the top of the chicken, and bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Allow pie to rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving. Top with sour cream and cilantro if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together masa flour, salt, chili powder, and baking powder.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":20317,"name":"masa harina","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/corn-flour.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add vegetable oil and chicken broth, and mixon low until combined.
