Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs and vanilla, and beat for 7 to 8 minutes.  ?(Don't skip this 10 minute creaming step- it is what makes their cookies so good! You want the mixture to get really fluffy, pillowy and pale.)Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, milk powder, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and rainbow sprinkles. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute. (Do not walk away from the machine during this step, or you will risk overmixing the dough.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. ??Still on low speed, add the birthday cake crumbs and mix in for 30 seconds—just until they are incorporated. ??Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3-cup measure), portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes flat. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. Do not bake your cookies from room temperature—they will not bake properly. ??Heat the oven to 350°F.Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pans. Bake for 18 minutes. (Once again mine needed less- 14 minutes was the perfect time for mine. I'd keep checking on yours to find the sweet spot.)  The cookies will puff, crackle, and spread. After 18 minutes, they should be very lightly browned on the edges (golden brown on the bottom). The centers will show just the beginning signs of color. Leave the cookies in the oven for an additional minute or so if the colors don’t match and the cookies still seem pale and doughy on the surface.Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage. At room temp, the cookies will keep fresh for 5 days; in the freezer, they will keep for 1 month.For the Birthday Cake Crumb: Heat the oven to 300°F.??Combine the sugars, flour, baking powder, salt, and sprinkles in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until well combined.??Add the oil and vanilla and paddle again to distribute. The wet ingredients will act as glue to help the dry ingredients form small clusters; continue paddling until that happens.??Spread the clusters on a parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pan. Bake for 20 minutes, breaking them up occasionally. The crumbs should still be slightly moist to the touch; they will dry and harden as they cool.??? (Mine needed WAY less time. They were done after 10/12 minutes. I'd set your timer for 12 and check on them. You don't want them to be browned.)Let the crumbs cool completely before using in a recipe or scarfing by the handful.
