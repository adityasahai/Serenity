Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400F.Slice butternut squash in half and scoop out seeds. Place each half cut side down in a large roasting dish and pour 1/2 inch of water into the bottom. Place in oven and bake until tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Once done, remove and let cool.While squash is roasting, cook pasta shells according to directions. Cook until pasta is al dente (tender, but not over soft).When squash has cooled enough to handle, scrape out the flesh into a bowl and discard the skins. Mix in maple syrup and nutmeg until thoroughly incorporated.To make sauce, melt butter in a medium sized pot over medium low heat. Pour in heavy cream, garlic, sage, and rosemary. Reduce heat and continue to cook the sauce without boiling the cream until the cream has thickened slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually stir in 1/2 cup of parmesan and keep stirring until the cheese is completely melted.Pour 1/4 of the sauce in the bottom of a medium baking dish. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of butternut filling into each pasta shell. Place stuffed pasta shell in the dish and repeat until pasta shells are filled. Pour remaining sauce over the shells and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of parmesan.Return stuffed shells in the oven and bake until sauce starts to bubble and slightly brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with a sprinkle of fresh sage.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400F.Slice butternut squash in half and scoop out seeds.","ingredients":[{"id":11485,"name":"butternut squash","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butternut-squash.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place each half cut side down in a large roasting dish and pour 1/2 inch of water into the bottom.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place in oven and bake until tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.
