with Malbec, Merlot, and Zinfandel. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Don Rodolfo Malbec with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438361,"title":"Don Rodolfo Malbec","description":"An intense ruby red color with violet flashes. Aromas of berries, cassis and plums.

In a small food processor, add the lardons (or cooked bacon and drippings) Dijon mustard, garlic, egg, salt, pepper, ground clove and anise seeds and process into a paste.Add that to a medium mixing bowl along with the ground beef, jalapeño pepper, parsley, mint, rosemary and sauerkraut and knead well with your hands until uniformly blended. Form the meat mixture into 3 or 4 beef patties.Preheat your outdoor grill to high. Once your grill is nice and hot, lower the heat to medium and place the patties on the grill; cook for about 3-4 minutes per side or until the patties are done to your liking.Alternatively, you could also cook the beef patties in a large skillet set over medium-high heat, again, about 3-4 minutes per side. While the meat is cooking, pan fry as many eggs as you will require to garnish your burgers. To assemble the burgers, start by laying a few pieces of kale at the bottom of a plate. Place the beef patty right over that, followed by the sauerkraut and a few slices of tomatoes and avocado. At this point, you might want to insert a toothpick right in the center of the pile to make sure your mile high burger doesn't collapse on you! Once everything is good and secure, add the pan fried egg right on top of all that and, finally, place two pieces of cooked bacon right over your egg. BEAUTY! Take a nice long look (if you can!) at your beautiful creation and dig in.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by cooking the required number of slices of bacon (depending on how many burgers you are making and whether or not you are using cooked bacon in your meat patties) and set aside.
