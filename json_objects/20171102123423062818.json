Whisk well to combine and dissolve salt.Add pork and soak for 3 hours in the refrigerator.After 3 hours, remove the pork from the brine and pat dry.While the pork is soaking in the brine, prepare the sweet potato and rice.Sweet Potato and Rice Cake:Start with cooking the rice. I just cook mine in a rice cooker. You can prepare this however you normally prepare rice.Next move on to the sweet potato. Wash well and prick the sweet potato all over with a fork. Place on a plate in the microwave and cook for 15 minutes on high to steam. Flip sweet potatoes every five minutes to make sure they cook evenly.Prepare the remaining ingredients for the cakes and once the sweet potatoes are cooled, scrape them from the skins and combine all of the cake ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.On a large sheet pan lined with a Silpat or parchment, portion out mixture with a 1/8 measuring cup.Refrigerate for at least an hour for the mixture to firm. We'll cook them later once the pork is closer to being ready.Once the pork is removed from the brine, proceed to prepare it for the oven. Pre-heat the oven to 350 ºF.Roasting the Pork:Heat the clarified butter in a skillet over high heat. Sear for 3 minutes on the fat side cap side (if still on the roast).Flip the roast and sear for 3 minutes on the second side.Using tongs, finish searing the small sides of the roast, about a minute each.Transfer the pork to a baking dish lined with aluminum foil. If you still have the fat cap on, place the roast in the oven fat side up.Cook 40 minutes. Using a bio-thermometer, check to make sure the internal temperature is 145 ºF. When reached, remove the pork roast from the oven and allow to sit for 3 minutes before cutting.Once cool enough to handle, trim off the fat cap (if still on the roast). Next, slice the roast against the grain, about half an inch thick.While the pork is roasting, proceed to prepare the Sweet Potato and Rice Cake and the Sweet and Sour Glaze. Try to start these last two components below about 10-15 minutes out from the pork being done. If possible, try to prepare both at the same time.Sweet and Sour Glaze: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine.Add the mixture to a small skillet over medium high heat.Lightly boil for about 2 minutes, until sauce is slightly thickened.Cover the skillet lightly with foil to keep the glaze warm.Finishing the Sweet Potato and Rice Cake:Add a about a tablespoon of butter to a large skillet. Allow it to melt over medium high heat.Once butter is melted and skillet is sufficiently heated, add the sweet potato and rice cakes. Cook in batches and don't overload the skillet.Cook 3 minutes on the first side. Carefully flip and gently flatten the cake with the spatula. Cook another 3 minutes on the second side.Carefully remove the cakes from the skillet and repeat to finish cooking the portioned cake mix.While batch cooking, keep finished cakes warm under foil.Once the pork is done, proceed to finish plating the dish.Plating the Final Dish:Place 3-4 slices of pork loin on a plate and dress with some of the Sweet and Sour Glaze.Add 4-5 sweet potato and rice cakes to the plate to finish.If desired, garnish with extra thinly sliced green onion.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Add a about a tablespoon of butter to a large skillet.
