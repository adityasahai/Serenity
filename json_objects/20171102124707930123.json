meal","brunch","breakfast"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Whisk together the eggs, both kinds of sugar, buttermilk, butter, and vanilla in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the egg mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in the chocolate, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes.                          Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.                          Heat a large cast-iron griddle or nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Brush with butter and continue heating until the butter begins to foam. Drop scant 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the griddle. Bake until bubbles start to form and burst, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook to set the other side, another 1 to 2 minutes. As the pancakes are ready, put them in a single layer on the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.                          Stack the pancakes on plates, drizzle with the warm caramel sauce, and top with a sprinkling of confectioners' sugar and some raspberries, if desired.                          Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup cold water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring or touching, until the sugar turns a deep amber color, 8 to 10 minutes.                          Meanwhile, warm the cream in a small saucepan or in the microwave. When the caramel is ready, slowly whisk in the cream and continue simmering until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and salt until combined. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the eggs, both kinds of sugar, buttermilk, butter, and vanilla in a small bowl until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":10014214,"name":"instant espresso","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/instant-coffee-or-instant-espresso.png"},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19165,"name":"cocoa powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cocoa-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the egg mixture and whisk until just combined.
