Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. You could try Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon.

The nose is complex with ripe blackcurrant cassis and red cherry fruit anchored by attractive base notes of oak, earthiness and a wisp of woodsmoke. The wine attacks with bright fleshy cherry fruit built upon by layers of leaf and leather. The finish is mouthfilling and lingering and the tannins giving persistent flesh and presence.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/437917-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ringbolt-cabernet-sauvignon-2009/112598"}]},"instructions":"Preheat grill to medium-low indirect heat.In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients.Shape meat mixture into two loaves.Top with barbecue sauce mixture.Grill for 1 hour or until internal temperature reaches 155F (68C).Let rest for about ten minutes before slicing and serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat grill to medium-low indirect heat.In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients.Shape meat mixture into two loaves.Top with barbecue sauce mixture.Grill for 1 hour or until internal temperature reaches 155F (68C).","ingredients":[{"id":6150,"name":"barbecue sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/barbecue-sauce.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let rest for about ten minutes before slicing and serving.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
