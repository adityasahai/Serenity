A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428725,"title":"NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled","description":"A personal favorite of our director of wine production Jonathan Hunt. Put your feet up after work or after dinner, sip our Ruby Port, and relax. This wine features rich berry notes and a long, smooth finish. Our smooth and hearty Ruby Port begins with a blend of Corot Noir and Chambourcin wines. We then fortify the blend with 100% grape brandy (distilled spirits) and sweeten it to bring all the flavors into perfect balance. Serve at cool room temperature.","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428725-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Country-Vineyards-Finger-Bottled/dp/B00OGL9P14"}]},"instructions":"Place a metal mixing bowl over a pot of hot water.
