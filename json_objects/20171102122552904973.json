great choices for Fingerfood. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Pour the mixture into a medium non-stick saucepan, add the salsa, and stir as you bring to a boil. Reduce heat and continue to cook, stirring, for at least 2 minutes after boiling. Sauce should be thick and smooth. Set aside. Heat a large, non-stick skillet. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet and cook until brown spots begin to appear on the bottom. Flip over. Spread half of the “cheese” over the tortilla. (If you are adding any other fillings place them on top of the cheese.) Cover with another tortilla. Cover pan and cook for a minute or two, until the bottom tortilla is golden brown. Carefully flip the whole thing over and cook until the bottom tortilla has browned. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into four triangles with a pizza cutter. Repeat with remaining sauce and tortillas.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour the mixture into a medium non-stick saucepan, add the salsa, and stir as you bring to a boil.
