On the mean time, in a large bowl, mix the rest of the ingredients, except the apples and raisins if using and set aside.Preheat the oven to 275F. When the apple cider has reduced to 1 cup, turn heat off and add the honey, oil and spices and combine. I used a wire whisk for this step. Pour this mixture over the oats and toss until the oats are evenly coated.Spread the mixture over two large cookie sheets and bake for 25 minutes. Transfer the granola to the large bowl you previously used and toss around. Divide over the cookie sheets again and bake for another 25 minutes or until the granola has browned a bit. Because I make such large amounts my granola takes about double the time. I normally have to repeat this step 4 times.Cool the granola completely before transferring it to an air tight container.  At this stage you can add the apples and raisins if using. These are the glass containers I use. I have two of them and they are great.The granola will keep for at least 3 weeks.  ","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan, over high heat, cook the cider until it has been reduced to 1 cup.
