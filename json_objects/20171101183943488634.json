White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices.

Cover each ramekin with 1 dough circle, pressing the overhang to the sides of the dish to adhere. Cover and chill. Pies may be assembled 1 day in advance.Heat the oven to 350F.
