Sangiovese, Barbera Wine, and Shiraz. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese.

Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. This will activate the yeast-- it should look foamy. If it doesn't, your yeast may be expired... go get some fresh yeast!In a large bowl, combine flour and kosher salt. Add the yeast mixture along with the olive oil and mix until thoroughly combined.Transfer dough to a floured surface. Knead the dough for 5 minutes and shape into a ball. Place the dough into an oiled mixing bowl and turn to coat. Cover and allow to rise for 1 ½ - 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.Meanwhile, make the balsamic reduction and caramelized onions. To make the balsamic reduction, add the balsamic vinegar and maple syrup to a small saucepan and cook on medium-low heat until the liquid has reduced to ¼ its original volume, roughly 15 - 20 minutes. Check and stir regularly to make sure it doesn't burn.When finished, the reduction will be very dark in color, similar to chocolate syrup. To make caramelized onions, place sliced onions in a dry pan over medium-high heat and cover with a lid. Check and stir regularly, until a good amount of color has developed, about 5-7 minutes. Deglaze your pan using the ¼ cup of water, stir the onions well and be sure to scrape up the brown bits that have collected on the bottom of the pan. Once the water has cooked off, add 1 tbsp olive oil and salt and continue to cook the onions about another 5 minutes. When finished, the onions should have a nice deep dark brown color and a sweet smell.Once the dough has doubled in size, you are ready to assemble and bake the pizza. Preheat oven to 450 degrees and place a pizza stone or sheet pan into the oven to allow it to come to temperature as well. (A pizza stone is recommended; they are a great investment if you're planning to make a lot of pizza, because they help the crust bake evenly and crisply).Punch down the dough ball down flat and place on a floured surface. To roll out, start in the middle and roll towards the edges, giving a quarter turn with each back-and-forth motion. Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Roll out to roughly 13” across. Poke several small holes with a fork in the bottom of the crust.Sprinkle a good amount of corn meal onto a lightweight cutting board before transferring your rolled dough to the new surface for topping assembly. Brush the crust with olive oil.To slice figs, first remove stems, then cut in half. Cut each half into thirds. Then sprinkle the caramelized onions, sliced figs, and goat cheese across the top of the pizza. Be sure to sprinkle the toppings evenly. Carefully transfer the assembled pizza to your preheated pizza stone or sheet pan. Bake for 10-12 minutes or desired doneness. Allow the pizza to cool slightly, then top with fresh arugula and drizzle with the balsamic reduction. Slice, serve, and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine water, sugar and yeast in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.
