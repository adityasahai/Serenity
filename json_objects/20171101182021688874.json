White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Black beans and chicken breast, simmered in the slow cooker make the perfect filling for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or even a burrito bowl and it's loaded with fiber.Personally, I love this served in crunchy corn taco shells. I make a quick red cabbage slaw which adds a little acidity and crunch, and it's a healthier option than iceberg. Add some spicy pico de gallo for freshness and avocados, and I am one happy gal! So good you won't even miss the cheese!I often make my own pico de gallo, but when I'm pressed for time, I have no problem buying it. There are lots of great options in the refrigerated produce section of the supermarket, Nature's Promise is usually my go-to, is organic and has just the right amount of kick.Avocado is so good on tacos, and loaded with heart healthy fats. It's creamy and delicious and I totally skip the sour cream, but if you rather save on calories and leave it out, fat free Greek yogurt works fine in it's place.Slow Cooker Black Bean and Chicken TacosSkinnytaste.comServings: 4  Size: 3 tacos  Points +:8 pt (10 w avocado) Smart Points:9Calories: 313  Fat: 8 g  Carb: 41 g  Fiber: 8 g  Protein: 22 g  Sugar: 4 gSodium: 716 mg (without added salt)Ingredients:12 oz raw skinless chicken tenders or breast15 oz can low sodium black beans, drained and rinsed (Goya)10 oz can tomatoes with mild green chiles (I used Rotel)1 1/8 tsp chili powder3/4 tsp plus 1/8th tsp ground cumin1/4 tsp garlic powder1/4 tsp oregano1 medium scallion, diced1 tbsp chopped cilantro (optional)For the Slaw:1 1/3 cups shredded red cabbage1 tsp red wine vinegar (or lime juice)salt and black pepper, to tasteFor the Taco:12 crisp corn taco shellsOptional toppings: (not calculated)pico de gallo1 medium haas avocado, sliced (+ add 2 pts per serving)Directions:Season chicken with pinch of salt, garlic powder, oregano, 1/8 tsp of the chili powder and 1/8th tsp cumin.Add the beans and tomatoes to the crock pot and season with the remaining chili powder and cumin.
