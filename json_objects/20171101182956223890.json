A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is Giessinger Surrender Chocolate Strawberry Port. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 50 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":431345,"title":"Giessinger Surrender Chocolate Strawberry Port","description":"It is when we Surrender to the power and the long-lived beauty of the mind without regards to the short-lived physical beauty that we experience satisfaction.

Place 7 (6 oz) custard cups on an 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet.Place white chocolate and butter in a medium-microwave safe mixing bowl. Heat in microwave in 30 second intervals on 50% power, stirring well between intervals until melted and smooth (the last interval you may only need 15 seconds. Now at this point be sure you have all remaining cake ingredients ready to add because if you add the flour and let it sit very long the mixture will thicken and clump and it just won't mix together as well). Stir in flour, powdered sugar and salt then add in eggs, egg yolks, lemon curd, lemon zest and vanilla and whisk well to combined.Spray custard cups well with non-stick baking spray then pour mixture into cups filling each about 2/3 full (1/2 cup in each). Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden brown and centers are puffy and just beginning to set, about 14 - 17 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack 10 minutes (meanwhile whip heavy cream. Alternately you can let them cool just a few minutes and serve really warm dusted with powdered sugar and omitting the whipped cream). Run a knife around edge to ensure they are loosened then invert cakes onto individual dessert plates.For the toppings:In a medium mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer set on high speed whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Stir in powdered sugar then whip until stiff peaks form. Transfer mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.
