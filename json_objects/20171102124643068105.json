White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOXÂ® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/chehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009/109305"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the broiler. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs; drain and set aside.                          Meanwhile, season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-highheat. Add the chicken and cook until golden and cooked through, 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet.                          Add the red peppers and oregano to the skillet; cook, flipping the peppers, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Lay a pepper half on each piece of chicken. Top each with a slice of mozzarella.                          Add the remaining 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil and the garlic to the skillet; cook until softened, 1 minute. Add the kale and cook until slightly wilted, 2 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil; cook until the kale is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the pasta and parmesan; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until warmed through.                          Transfer the chicken to the broiler and broil until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve with the kale pasta.
