A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Sonoma Portworks DECO port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428769,"title":"NV Sonoma Portworks DECO port","description":"A unique California after-dinner wine, DECO is an exceptional blend of hand-selected California ports gently kissed with essences of natural dark chocolate. DECO has wonderful dark chocolate notes in the bouquet, followed by a rich, silky smoothness on the palate.

Take a taste. It will be slightly tart. I liked it that way. You can also add 2 T of maple syrup or honey to sweeten it more if you like. I did not add any sweetener to mine. Pour contents into ice pop molds or an ice cream machine.  Mine took about 20 minutes in the machine.The ice cream will come out like soft serve. If you prefer a harder ice cream, place in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour to firm up. Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Throw all the ingredients in a blender and blend for about 90 seconds. Take a taste. It will be slightly tart.
