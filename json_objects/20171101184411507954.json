Sauvignon, Chablis, and Malbec. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. The DeLille Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 70 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":457303,"title":"DeLille Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"This vintage has powerful yet harmonious fruit and oak balance. Classically structured with great lift, the 2013 Four Flags includes rich cassis, black cherries and pine nut nuances. Add savory ripe tannins, toasty oak, exotic spices of coriander and cardamom along with a smoky texture and you can see how complex and dynamic itis right now. Equally important, there are clues as to where this wine is headed as it develops over the next decade.","price":"$69.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/457303-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/delille-four-flags-cabernet-sauvignon-2013/176062"}]},"instructions":"In a large stock pot over high heat, add onion, garlic, and 2 tablespoons broth and saute for approximately 5 minutes.
