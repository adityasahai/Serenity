Heating this mixture a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.Transfer the sugar mixture to a medium-sized mixing bowl, if you've heated it in a saucepan.

Spoon warm jelly on top of brownie batter. Use a knife to swirl around to mix into brownies.Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it. The brownies should feel set on the edges, and the center should look very moist, but not uncooked.
