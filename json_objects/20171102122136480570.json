Try pairing with Sparkling rosé and Sparkling Wine. If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam. Uncorked at the very last minute, Bellissima Sparkling Rosé pairs perfectly with smoked salmon, shellfish, and seafood hor d’oeuvres such as tuna tartare, sushi, and sashimi.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/458665-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/bellissima-sparkling-rose/293794"}]},"instructions":"Basically, for the filling we will be making mashed potatoes. Cook potatoes in salty water until they are cooked. Drain water from cooked potatoes. Mash them with some warm milk and butter. Whisk eggs together with sour cream and milk until you get an even texture. To the liquid ingredients, add in flour, baking powder and salt. You can combine all ingredients with a mixer, hands or using a spatula. Roll out the dough on a well floured surface. Cut circles out of the dough, using a cookie cutter or simply a floured glass cup. One by one, fill dough with a filling, turn the edge over and pinch them together with your fingers.Flour the surface where you plan to place pierogi, you can place them on a cooking sheet and freeze them. For longer storage, you can shift the frozen pierogig to a ziplock bag and continue holding them in the freezer for several months. Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. One by one, add pierogi into the boiling water. Once they will float to the top, i.e. 10-15 minutes into the cooking, pierogi are cooked. Sautee onion to a golden brown, add pierogi to it. Fry sides of pierogi to a golden brown.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Basically, for the filling we will be making mashed potatoes.
