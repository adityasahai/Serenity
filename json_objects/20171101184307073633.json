The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 °C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"In a measuring cup, combine water heated to 115F with yeast, sugar and olive oil. Allow mixture to sit for 5-10 minutes.Using a stand mixer with dough hook attachment, add 2 1/4 cups flour and sea salt. With mixer running on low, slowly add liquid mixture. Continue mixing, increasing speed and adding an additional tablespoon of flour at a time, up to 1/4 cup, until the dough is smooth and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl. Cover and allow to rise until doubled in size, roughly one hour. Use immediately or transfer to refrigerator to sit for 24-48 hours (allowing for a more flavorful dough).To a small saucepan, add chicken, spices and enough chicken stock or water to cover. Cook over medium heat, removing chicken when no longer pink to shred. Return shredded chicken to saucepan, soaking in the seasoned liquid. Increase temperature slightly, continuing to cook until liquid boils off. Remove chicken, set aside.Preheat oven to 425F. Lightly grease a large baking pan. If making one large pizza, stretch to desired shape and size. If making two smaller pizzas, divide dough in half and shape to desired shapes and sizes. Bake crust for 8 minutes as is. Remove and top off as desired using amounts below.*Amounts listed below are each for one small pizza, double amounts if only making one large pizza.Salsa taco pizza:Lightly spread 5-6 Tbsp salsa over prepared dough. Top off with half of the shredded seasoned chicken, 1/2 cup freshly shredded whole milk mozzarella, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, jalapeo slices, chopped green onions and a sprinkle of ground black pepper.Tortilla taco pizza:Lightly brush olive oil over prepared dough. Add half of the shredded seasoned chicken, 1/2 cup freshly shredded whole milk mozzarella, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, seasoned tortilla strips, chopped green onions and a sprinkle of ground black pepper.Bake prepared pizza for an additional 10-15 minutes or until desired crispness is reached.
