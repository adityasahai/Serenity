Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook pasta according to directions. Scoop out a cup of pasta water before you drain it.While the pasta is cooking, saute bacon in a large deep skillet until crispy. Remove and set aside, leaving drippings in the skillet.Add the spinach to the skillet and cook over medium heat until wilted. Add pasta and corn and saute until warmed through. Add butter and just enough pasta water to make a light sauce and toss again.
