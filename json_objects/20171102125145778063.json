Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with canola oil spray. Sprinkle the fish with the salt and place it in the pan.

Bake until the fish is just opaque in the center, about 15 minutes. Garnish with more cilantro and serve with the rice.
