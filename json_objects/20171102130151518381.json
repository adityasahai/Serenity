Beer might seem like the natural pick for German food, but German riesling pairs wonderfully with seafood and schnitzel, while a German red like Dornfelder goes well with beef and game meat. You could try Poet's Leap Riesling.

Set aside at room temperature to allow flavors time to marinate. Serve with schnitzel. Use a slotted spoon for serving so that the juices from the tomatoes don't make the schnitzel soggy.If you'd like to grill the vegetables (I love doing this as it adds a lot of flavor), shuck and clean the corn cob of its silks. Brush corn and pepper with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill both corn and pepper for 10 minutes on high heat, turning every 2-3 minutes, till corn is tender and blackened in places and pepper is softened, blackened and collapsing. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.Remove corn from cob. I prefer to use a bundt pan, placing one end of the cob in the center and slicing the kernels off with a sharp knife so that they fall neatly into the pan. Measure out 1 1/4 cups corn and reserve. Save any additional corn to add to a salad, or you can add it to the tomato relish if you prefer.If you're not grilling the corn, steam it till tender, then allow to cool to room temperature before removing the kernels from the cob. If using frozen corn, run under warm water till it is thawed, then drain and pat dry. If using canned corn, drain and pat dry. If you're not grilling the pepper, then roast it, peel, and let cool, or use a pre-roasted peeled pepper.Dice the peeled cooked pepper into small pieces.In a mixing bowl, combine flour, 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs, salt, smoked paprika, cumin, sugar and cayenne. In a separate mixing bowl, combine beaten eggs, lemon juice and scallions. Combine the egg mixture with the dry ingredients. Mix well.Mix corn kernels and diced peppers into batter. At this point, you can cover the batter with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to overnight (which will make it easier to handle and make into breaded patties), or you can proceed immediately with the recipe.To bread the schnitzel, fill the bottom of a shallow baking dish with 1 cup panko breadcrumbs. Drop  cupfuls of batter into breadcrumbs using an ice cream scoop or measuring cup (I like using an ice cream scoop). Gently flatten the batter into a patty, shaping it as you go, and coat the opposite side with crumbs. The patties will be delicate and somewhat prone to crumbling, but they will hold together much better after being fried in hot oil. Remove from panko with a spatula.Heat 1/4 inch of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat till hot enough for frying. Add breaded schnitzels gently to the hot oil. Cook for approximately 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.Serve schnitzel warm topped with heirloom tomato relish and optional sour cream or Greek yogurt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"A few minutes before cooking the schnitzel, place all tomato relish ingredients in a small mixing bowl and stir to combine.
