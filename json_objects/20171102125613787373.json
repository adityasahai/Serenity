Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Gruener Veltliner. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441154,"title":"King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris","description":"Light straw with emerald green hue.

Brush and oil the grill grate.In a small bowl, stir together the chilies and the 1 Tbs. oil. Brush the fish with oil and season with salt and pepper. Working in batches, grill the tortillas until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Wrap in foil or a kitchen towel to keep them warm.For a charcoal grill: Sprinkle the wood chips over the coals. Place the chilies over the hottest part of the fire. Grill, turning once, until nicely charred, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Grill the fish over the hottest part of the fire until opaque and nicely charred, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn the fish and grill until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more.For a gas grill: Increase 1 burner to high. Heat a smoker box half full of wood chips until smoking, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Place the chilies over the heating elements. Grill, turning once, until nicely charred, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Grill the fish over the heating elements until opaque and nicely charred, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn the fish and grill until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more.Roughly chop the grilled chilies and place them in small bowl. Squeeze 1 or 2 lime wedges over them and stir to coat.Transfer the fish to a board and flake each fillet into small pieces. To assemble the grilled fish tacos, place several pieces of fish and some grilled chilies atop 2 stacked warm corn tortillas. Top with the lettuce, salsa, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and cilantro. Garnish with a few dashes of hot-pepper sauce and serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.Adapted from Williams-Sonoma On the Grill, by Willie Cooper (Oxmoor House, 2009).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Brush and oil the grill grate.In a small bowl, stir together the chilies and the 1 Tbs. oil.","ingredients":[{"id":11819,"name":"chili pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-chili.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Brush the fish with oil and season with salt and pepper.
