Cut the leaves at the base, where they were connected to the root; the leaves should be about 9 inches long. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the center rib so the leaves roll up more easily. Set aside.                          Stir the cream cheese, scallions, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl to combine.                          Lay 1 of the tortillas on a clean work surface, and place 1 of the romaine leaves neatly on top. Place 2 slices of the ham next to each other to fit neatly on top of the lettuce. Spread 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture over the ham, then line up a quarter of the roasted pepper strips along one edge. Line up 1/4 cup of the shredded carrots on top of the peppers. Roll up the wrap tightly, starting from the edge with the peppers and carrots, so the wrap holds together with the peppers and carrots in the middle. Place the wrap seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, peppers, carrots, ham and cream cheese mixture. Cut the wraps into 1-inch pieces, then skewer each piece from the top through the seam side with a toothpick or skewer.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: Toothpicks","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404644,"name":"toothpicks","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/toothpicks.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Carefully wash and dry the 4 largest outer romaine leaves, trying not to tear them.","ingredients":[{"id":10111251,"name":"romaine","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/romaine"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Cut the leaves at the base, where they were connected to the root; the leaves should be about 9 inches long.
