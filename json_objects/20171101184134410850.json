Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Piper-Heidsieck Brut Cuvee. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":450714,"title":"Piper-Heidsieck Brut Cuvee","description":"Piper-Heidsieck Cuv√©e Brut is a classic, structured, full-bodied and bursting with fruit Champagne.
