A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

(Alternatively, use a coffee filter lined with filter paper.) Spoon in yogurt and let drain in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes. Toss strawberries with 3 tablespoons sugar in a bowl. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until a syrup has formed, 20 to 30 minutes.To make biscuits: Position rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or coat it with cooking spray. Whisk together flour, cocoa, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Cut butter and cream cheese into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or your fingertips until crumbly. Make a well in the center and add buttermilk, stirring with a fork until evenly moistened. Drop 4 mounds of batter, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheet. Shape the mounds into 3-inch circles and bake until the tops spring back when touched lightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer biscuits to a rack and let cool slightly.To assemble shortcakes: Slice the biscuits in half crosswise with a serrated knife. Set bottoms on dessert plates. Spoon the strawberries and syrup over the biscuits and add a dollop of the drained yogurt. Top with the biscuit tops, dust with confectioners sugar and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make filling: Line a sieve with cheesecloth and set it over a bowl.
