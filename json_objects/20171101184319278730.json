If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. One wine you could try is Bellissima Sparkling rosé. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Add pulled pork. Cook until warmed through. Mix in sriracha, ginger, garlic powder, soy sauce and sesame seeds.  Remove from heat. Stir in green onions.    To make the wontons, place 1 heaping teaspoon of the pork mixture in the center of the wonton wrapper. Dip your finger into a bowl of water and run your finger along the edges of the wrapper. Fold bottom corner of the wrapper over the filling  and press all edges to close the wrapper, you’ll have a triangle. For presentation purposes, with the top of the triangle facing away from me, I folded the left and right corners in, but it is not necessary, you just want to make sure it is closed.    When you are ready to fry them, heat a 1 inch of oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Once it reaches 375, fry the wontons, in batches if necessary until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Serve hot, with more sriracha on the side of course.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add pulled pork.
