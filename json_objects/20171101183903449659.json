Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Bellafina Prosecco with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":461572,"title":"Bellafina Prosecco","description":"Intensely aromatic and crisp on the palate, with aromas and flavorsof yellow apple, white peach, pear and notes of white flowers.Excellent as an aperitif, it is a perfect accompaniment to hors-d'oeuvres and delicate first courses.
