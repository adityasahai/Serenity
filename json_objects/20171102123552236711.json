and Malbec are my top picks for Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. You could try Groth Cabernet Sauvignon. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 59 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442462,"title":"Groth Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon is big and lush with huge gobs of fruit in the aroma and flavor. The texture of the wine is soft and supple, typical of Cabernet Sauvignons grown in our area of the Oakville AVA. Patience during bottle aging will reward the \"steward\" with an outstanding bottle over the next 10 to 15 years.Try this Cabernet with a lamb loin marinated in olive oil and garden herbs with lemon mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and Swiss chard.","price":"$58.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442462-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/groth-cabernet-sauvignon-2006/98801"}]},"instructions":"<p>Step 2 - Fifteen minutes before the stew has finished cooking, make the dumplings. In a small bowl, mix together the flour and baking powder. In a measuring jug, mix the butter, egg and cheese with a fork. Add the wet mix to the flour and using a spoon, stir to combine. You may need 1 or 2 tablespoons of water to help it come together. Roll into 8 balls with your hands and place on top of the stew. I keep the lid on while I am making it so that the stew heats up even more and then once the dumplings are made, just put them in and replace with the lid. Turn the heat up to medium so that the dough has a chance to rise.
