Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":459422,"title":"Cecchi Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia","description":"Chianti Classico Riserva di Famiglia is certainly the most representative wine of Cecchi.
