White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.
