Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Allow the kale to drain. Cut the kale into thin strips or small pieces.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Break the pasta in half, add it to the boiling water, and cook according to the package directions. Drain the pasta in a colander.While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil, butter, and minced garlic to another large pot or skillet. Cook over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the kale and continue to saut until the kale has wilted and has turned a deep green color (about 5-7 minutes). Turn the heat off.Add the drained pasta to the pot with the sauted kale. Toss the pasta and kale together. Allow them to cool to the point that steam is no longer rising from the pot.

Add a pinch of red pepper flakes over top if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Tear the kale leaves from the woody stems and rinse well in a colander under cool, running water.
