Knead for 8-10 minutes until you have a smooth pliable dough. Cover the bowl and allow to rest for 30 minutes. Make the cabbage while dough is resting. Heat a pizza stone (alternatively you can heat a baking tray) in the oven at 220 degrees C. After the resting period divide the dough in 4 pieces, rolling each one into a smooth ball. With a rolling pin roll 4 small oval bases. Cover with a damp cloth and allow to rest for another 30 minutes. For the cabbage and pear: melt the butter in a large non-stick pan then sprinkle the sugar and allow the sugar to melt. Add the cabbage and toss several times to coat with the buttery-sugary sauce. On gentle heat allow the cabbage to caramelize for 8-10 minutes. Add the spices and herbs and cook for another 3-5 minutes, then pour the orange juice and the zest, toss well allow simmer until flavors have infused. Finally add the pear cubes and heat through. Set aside to cool. For the bratwrst: heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the garlic and thyme and infuse the oil on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Saut the sausage meat until just turning golden  the meat will cook further in the oven so you need to make sure it does not overcook in the pan. To assembly the flammkuchen divide the cabbage mixture over the 4 flammkuchen and spread the bratwurst meat over each flammkuchen. Bake the flammkuchen, 2 at a time on the pizza stone for 10-12 minutes until the base is crispy and golden.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the flammkuchen base: add all the ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.
