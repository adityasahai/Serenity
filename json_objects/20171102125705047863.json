Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew.

It has a concentrated flavor profile of black fruit with a hint of chocolate and brown spice. With notes that are complex, full-bodied and expansive on the palate, it ends with firm tannins and a dash of espresso. This wine is balanced, with a supple texture and approachable grip.","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/469305-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Volta-Cabernet-Sauvignon-Mission-Valley/dp/B00GNKJZ02"}]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of water to a boil and have a large bowl with ice water and a spider or strainer standing by. Also have a tray ready for when you remove the tomatoes from the ice bath.Pull the stem off each tomato and make an X on the bottom of each. A few at a time, drop the tomatoes into the boiling water. After a minute or so, you will see the skins pull away from the X. With the spider or strainer, remove to the ice bath and then to the waiting tray. Repeat for all tomatoes adding more ice as needed.Place the tray of tomatoes on your counter and have a bowl with a strainer and a second bowl standing by. One at a time, pull the skin and place in strainer. Hold the tomatoes over the strainer as you seed them. For Roma, dig into the sides and scrape the seeds out, letting the seeds fall into the strainer. Pull the green inner stem and place with the seeds. Place the meat of the tomato into the other bowl. For the large tomatoes, after skinning, cut them in half on the horizon and reach in each half and scrape out the seeds letting them fall into the strainer. Pull the green hard inner stem out and place with the seeds. Place the meat in the bowl with the Roma’s. Once all the tomatoes have been cleaned, squeeze the seeds and skin to get every last bit of juice or pulp through the strainer. Discard seeds and skin.  The liquid in the bowl can now be added to the tomato meat in the other bowl. You should have about two quarts. There is no need to cut the tomatoes any further (the larger the better)In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium high heat, place olive oil, onion, celery, bell peppers, jalapeno, parsley, basil, mint, sugar, salt and red pepper flakes. Sauté mixture for 10 minutes.Add tomatoes, bring back up to a low boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 more minutes.  (Try not to break up the tomatoes too much while stirring)Taste, adjust seasoning and serve, refrigerate for up to four days or freeze in zip lock bags for up to six months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring a large pot of water to a boil and have a large bowl with ice water and a spider or strainer standing by.
