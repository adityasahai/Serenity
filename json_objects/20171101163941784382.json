With rich, cheesy mac & cheese you'll want to cleanse the palate with something crisp and acidic. We recommend Chenin Blanc, Riesling, or dry Lambrusco if you're in the mood for a red. The PRONTO Lambrusco Secco with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428385,"title":"PRONTO Lambrusco Secco","description":"Crimson purple color. Aromas are rich with purple iris, clove and licorice.

Drain the pasta through a colander and set aside.Heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat. As soon as the milk starts to steam and form tiny bubbles around its edges, turn the heat as low as it will go. The goal is to keep the milk warm but prevent it from boiling.Place the butter in a saucepan and melt over medium flame. Add the flour and stir with a heat-proof spatula just until the roux begins to take a light brown color, about 3 minutes, scraping the bottom to prevent burning. Once it’s done, the roux should smell liked cooked butter and flour.Slowly add the milk and stir constantly until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the sauce from the heat. Add shredded cheese and stir until completely melted. Stir in chopped vegetables, if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Pour sauce over pasta and stir to coat the noodles. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain the pasta through a colander and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404639,"name":"colander","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/colander.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat.
