Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Rex Hill Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 29 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449768,"title":"Rex Hill Willamette Valley Pinot Noir","description":"Aromas of violets, iris, ripe raspberries, dark cherries, rose, blueberries, wild strawberries and wet stones all emerge from the glass when the wine is first poured. As the wine opens, more savory aromas of wood smoke, cured tobacco, earth, sandalwood and cinnamon add complexity to the original aromatics. Structured, ripe and pure, the wine shows all hallmarks of the 2013 vintage.","price":"$28.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449768-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/rex-hill-willamette-valley-pinot-noir-2013/150589"}]},"instructions":"1.  Wash sweet potatoes and chop off the ends, then chop them into roughly ½” cubes.2.  Line a baking sheet with parchment and preheat the oven to 415º.3.  Add chopped sweet potatoes to a large bowl, pour in olive oil, cumin, chili powder, and 1 tsp. of salt. Use a spoon to mix the potatoes around until they are mostly coated with oil. Empty them onto the baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, removing once to stir the potatoes around the 15-minute mark.4.  While the sweet potatoes are baking, combine black beans, corn, 1 tsp. of salt, chipotle powder, and garlic powder in a saucepan and heat over medium-low.5.  Dice one sweet white onion and set it aside. Then chop an avocado into small chunks. These will be toppings for the tacos.6.  The sweet potatoes are done when they are fork-tender. Remove them from the oven, decrease the temperature to the lowest your oven allows, and let the potatoes cool for a few minutes.7.  Toss a couple of tortillas into the oven, directly on the rack works just fine. Allow them to warm for 3-5 minutes, then remove using tongs. Place the tortilla on a plate and load it up with the ingredients — beans and corn mixture, sweet potatoes, onion, and avocado. A spritz of lime adds the finishing touch to the flavors of these tacos.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Wash sweet potatoes and chop off the ends, then chop them into roughly ½” cubes.2.
