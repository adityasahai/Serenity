Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Perrier-Jouet Nuit Blanche with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 68 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":461023,"title":"Perrier-Jouet Nuit Blanche","description":"The sweeter taste, combined with the rounded and smooth mouth feel give the wine, a full body and richness that makes Perrier-Jouët Nuit Blanche the perfect champagne to awaken the senses.Perrier-Jouët Nuit Blanche is an exceptional Non-Vintage blend of 20% Chardonnay, 40% Pinot Noir and 40% Pinot Meunier, sweetened to taste with a 20g/l dosage of cane sugar to create a sensual style.","price":"$67.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/461023-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/perrier-jouet-nuit-blanche/137331"}]},"instructions":"Turn the boiler on in your oven.In a large bowl, whisk together the 10 eggs. Set aside.In an oven-proof skillet or cast iron pan over medium high heat, brown the ground turkey then add in sundried tomatoes and onions. Cook until onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes.Gently add in the kale leaves, little by little. They will wilt down a lot so as soon as one batch wilts down, start adding more.Once all the kale has wilted, season mixture with salt and pepper then pour the eggs into the pan.Let it cook for 1-2 minutes before running a spatula along the edge of the eggs & pan. Let cook for 1-2 minutes more, making sure the top of the frittata is still uncooked. Place the entire skillet carefully into the oven and broil for 3-5 minutes, watching it carefully as you don't want the top to burn.Once the top has cooked through and browned a little, carefully (with oven mitts) remove the pan and let cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.You can top with cheese, hot sauce, or whatever you wish. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Turn the boiler on in your oven.In a large bowl, whisk together the 10 eggs.
