Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Line 20 muffin cups with paper liners and place one Oreo in the bottom and center of each of the 20 cups, set aside. Chop remaining 8 Oreo cookies into small pieces, set aside. In a mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer set on medium speed, whip together cream cheese and sugar until smooth, about 1 minute. Blend in eggs. In a microwave safe bowl, combine white chocolate chips and cream and heat mixture on 50% power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until melted and smooth. Pour melted white chocolate chip mixture into cream cheese mixture, along with vanilla extract. Blend mixture until combined. Tap mixing bowl forcefully against counter top several times to release some of the large air bubbles in the cheesecake mixture, then fold in remaining 8 chopped Oreos. Divide mixture among 20 muffin cups (right over the top of each Oreo), filling each cup about 3/4 full (about 1/4 cup in each). Bake in preheated oven about 20 minutes, or until filling is set. Remove from oven and allow cupcakes to rest in muffin tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour, then transfer to an airtight container, in a single layer, and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Store cupcakes in refrigerator and serve chilled.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy adapted from my White Chocolate Cheesecake, inspired by Martha Stewart Cupcakes","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
