A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Remove from the heat and cool.  Coarsely chop the almonds.In a medium-sized, heavy bottomed saucepan, combined the coconut, sugar, chopped cranberries, chopped toasted almonds and egg whites.  Stir well.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for about 10 to 15 minutes.  (Stop cooking when the mixture turns from a creamy consistency to one that is sticky and moist, but not too dry.)Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extracts.Pour the mixture into a flat baking dish, spreading it out so that it will cool.  Place in the refrigerator for about ½ an hour or in the freezer for about 10 minutes if you want to speed up the process.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Using a small ice cream scoop (or your hands), scoop out the coconut mixture – firmly packing the macaroon mixture into the scoop – and place each mound on the baking sheet.  The cookies will not spread as you cook them, so you should be able to fit 18 good sized macaroons onto one baking sheet.Bake until lightly golden – about 30 minutes (more or less depending on your oven).  Place the baking sheet with the cookies still on it on a wire cooling rack and allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet so that they can set up. Once the cookies are cooled and firm, remove them from the baking sheet and place on the wire rack for glazing.  (You can place the wire rack onto the baking sheet to collect any drips if you’d like.)Melt the chocolate – on the stove in a double boiler, or in the microwave (in a heat-proof bowl, heat on high for 1 minute and then stir.  Continue to microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate is melted).Using a spoon, drizzle the chocolate evenly onto each macaroon.  Allow the chocolate to cool and set up (you can put it in the refrigerator if you’d like to speed up the process) before eating.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small, dry frying pan over medium heat, lightly toast the almonds for 3-4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from the heat and cool.
