great choices for Tacos. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 43 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/dutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014/154141"}]},"instructions":"Grate radishes and zucchini using a handheld grater or food processor attachment. Alternatively, you can cut them into tiny matchsticks using a mandoline or cut them by hand.Squeeze the juice of half a lime over the radish-zucchini mix and season with salt to taste. Set aside.Remove the corn kernels from the stalk and reserve. In a large nonstick skillet heat the olive oil. Add in the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add in the corn and cilantro and saute until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the ricotta salata, chili powder, and juice from half a lime. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat the tortillas. Prepare eggs as desired (I went with sunny side up). Top each warm tortilla with the corn-cilantro filling, zucchini-radish slaw, an egg, and avocado slices. Serve 2 tacos per person.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grate radishes and zucchini using a handheld grater or food processor attachment.
