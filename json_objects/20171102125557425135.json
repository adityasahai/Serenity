A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Set aside.                     In a small saucepan over med-low heat, cook chopped apples with 2 Tbsp of brown sugar, 1 Tbsp butter, and 1 tsp of cinnamon, for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until apples have begun to soften. Pull off heat and allow to cool.                     In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.                     In a another bowl, mix oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together.                     Making a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour in the wet ingredients and stir until combined.                     Add in grated zucchini (zucchini is a very wet vegetable, so try to pat off as much excess water as possible with a paper towel before adding to the batter) and cooled apples. Fold into the batter.                     Pour batter into prepared bread pan.                     Combine cinnamon, flour, and brown sugar. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter, and mix until the topping looks like coarse crumbs. Sprinkle coating evenly over the batter.                    Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean (My oven took exactly 55 minutes; around the 40-minute mark, I usually cover the bread with a piece of foil to keep the top from browning too much).                     Allow bread to cool before removing from pan.
