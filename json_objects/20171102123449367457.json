Combine the 2 cups flour, the sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the 2 tablespoons ice water; work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.2. Squeeze a small amount together; if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Form the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. (Feel free to make the dough the night before if you prefer.)Make the apple dumplings3. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper.4. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry out into a rectangle and cut evenly into four 6-inch squares. Gather up the scraps and roll out again. Using a 3-inch ring cutter, cut out 4 circles. Brush the surface of the pastry with some of the beaten eggs.5. Place an apple in the center of each square of dough. Stuff the core of each apple with a cherry. In a small bowl, combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Fill the apple centers with the cinnamon sugar. Bring the corners of the dough up to cover each apple and pinch the edges to seal. Set the pastry rounds on top of the apple dumplings like a little hat. Brush the dumplings with the beaten eggs.6. Put the apple dumplings in the prepared pan. Bake the dumplings until the pastry is golden brown and the apples are tender but not dissolved into apple sauce, 30 to 35 minutes.7. Put the confectioners’ sugar in a bowl and slowly pour in the hot water, stirring until the sugar is a pourable consistency. Drizzle over the apple dumplings and let cool slightly so the icing is hardened before serving. Serve warm with heavy cream or ice cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the pie pastry1.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the 2 cups flour, the sugar, and salt in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour in the 2 tablespoons ice water; work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.2.
