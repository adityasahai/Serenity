Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

(For those of us that are space impaired and do not have a mixer, mix a tablespoon of the chocolate into the eggs followed by two tablespoons and finally the remaining chocolate.  This is known as tempering and it slowly brings the eggs up to the temperature of the chocolate so that they do not cook when you mix in the rest of the chocolate.)Mix in the vanilla extract followed by the mixture of the flour, baking powder and salt.Fold in the rolos and caramels.Chill in the fridge or freezer until solid enough to work with.Spoon balls of the 'dough' onto a pair of parchment or silicon lined baking sheets.Bake in a pre-heated 350F oven for 11 minutes, remove and let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to racks to cool completely.Tip: Use an ice cream scoop to ensure that all of your cookies are the same size.  I used a two tablespoon scoop for these large cookies; use a one tablespoon scoop for smaller, 2 bite cookies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the chocolate chips and butter in a microwave safe bowl, heat them on high until melted in 30 second intervals and mix until smooth.
