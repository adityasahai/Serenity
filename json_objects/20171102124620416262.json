Stir until the yeast is dissolved, then set aside to proof for 5 minutes.In the meantime, sift flour and salt into the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the proofed yeast mixture, olive oil and chopped rosemary. Begin mixing at low speed, slowly work up to medium high speed as the dough starts to pull together into a ball. Continue mixing for another 5-6 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball, and transfer to a lightly-oiled bowl. Cover and place in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for an hour, or until just about doubled in size.Punch down the dough, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two pieces, and knead each one four or five times. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for five minutes.Roll out the first piece of dough into a 14×12 inch rectangle on a piece of parchment. Spread two tablespoons of honey mustard into a 4-inch wide strip running lengthwise down the middle of the rectangle, leaving a 4-inch border of uncovered dough on each side. Layer with half of the roasted red peppers, half of the turkey and half of the cheese. Repeat this process with the second piece of dough and the remaining fillings.To shape the braids, cut the borders on each side into ¾ inch wide strips, stopping within ½ inch of the filling. Starting at the top end of the loaf, fold down the first ¾ inch onto the filling. Repeat with the bottom edge, folding up the last ¾ inch of dough. Finally, fold in alternating strips at an angle across the filling to create a braid pattern. Pinch the ends to seal. Transfer each loaf to a baking sheet, then cover with a damp towel and let rise for 30 minutes or until slightly puffed.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400ºF.After half an hour, uncover the loaves, brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with caraway and cumin seeds. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until tops are golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing, or cool completely to room temperature to pack for a picnic.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, mix together warm water, sugar and yeast.
