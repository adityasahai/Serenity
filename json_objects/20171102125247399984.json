Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"Preheat broiler to highIn a small bowl, mix together the miso, honey, mirin, soy sauce, and ginger to form a thick sauce.If you've rinsed it, make sure the fish is very dry. Slather half the sauce on the exposed flesh of the fish, avoiding getting sauce on the skin (or the bottom flesh, if skinless). If you have time, marinate for 10-15 minutes. (If some sauce gets on the skin, just wipe it off a bit before putting it in the pan).Heat 2 teaspoons neutral oil in an ovenproof skillet on medium-high. Sear the fish, skin-side down, pressing the fish flat several times with a spatula so that it lies flush in the pan. Don't mash it to death, but you can use a bit of pressure here. Cook for three minutes, until the skin gets crispy.Carefully spoon another tablespoon of sauce over the flesh of each fillet. Try to avoid having it drip all over the pan so it doesn't get too smoky. Reserve the remaining sauce for drizzling. Pop the pan under the broiler for 4-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the filet and how well done you like it (I like salmon medium-rare and found that a 1 inch thick fillet took 5 minutes).While broiling, watch the fish carefully (the honey burns easily). If it starts to get too dark, move it down farther, away from the broiler.Serve it with the on steamed rice or rice noodles. Garnish with slices scallions, sesame seeds and lime segments.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat broiler to high","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small bowl, mix together the miso, honey, mirin, soy sauce, and ginger to form a thick sauce.If you've rinsed it, make sure the fish is very dry.
