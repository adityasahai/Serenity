Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Black River Winery Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430352,"title":"Black River Winery Merlot","description":null,"price":"$10.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430352-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2009-Black-River-Winery-Merlot/dp/B00ED59310"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.                          Place the tenderloin on a roasting rack. Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and sugar, which will deepen the savory flavors.                          Press the crushed peppercorns all over the surface of the meat. Insert a meat thermometer and place in the oven until the beef registers 120 to 125 degrees F for medium-rare/rare. Beef will probably cook in 20 to 25 minutes depending on its temp before it goes in the oven.                          While the meat is roasting, melt the butter with the garlic in a small skillet, and allow the butter to slightly brown. Remove the garlic and discard.                          Remove the meat when it's done and pour the garlic butter over gently (it should sizzle when it hits the meat). Cover the meat loosely with foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":475.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place the tenderloin on a roasting rack.
