Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Beat on high for 2 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the egg and yolk, mix until combined.In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.With mixing speed on low, gradually add the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold in the chopped chocolate and pretzel chunks with a large rubber spatula.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or baking mats, set aside.Using a standard size cookie scoop, create equal size balls of dough and drop onto the prepared cookie sheets. Press a pretzel into the top of each ball. Place in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, do not overbake! The cookies will be light in color and look underdone... that's ok! Remove from the oven (garnish with salt if desired) and allow to cool on the sheets for 3 minutes before carefully transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the sugars, peanut butter, butter and vanilla extract.
