Line an 8x8 square pan with parchment paper and grease with coconut oil.Combine coconut flour and salt in a bowl. Add the maple syrup and coconut oil and stir until fully combined and a large dough ball forms, making sure to press out any clumps of coconut oil. I used my hands at the end to bring the dough fully together - you want it to be completely smooth. You can also mix it in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.Press the dough into the prepared pan. Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. Let cool completely.Combine the almond butter, maple syrup, coconut butter or oil, vanilla, and salt in a small saucepan and heat until all of the ingredients are melted and throughly combined. Alternatively, you can heat the ingredients in the microwave for 45 seconds, or until melted and smooth. Add the toasted coconut and stir in. Pour over the crust and let cool in the refrigerator until set. Cut in 16 squares.Melt  cup of the dark chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave, and stir until smooth. Dip the bottom of each bar into the dark chocolate, scrape off the excess chocolate on the side of the bowl, and place on a parchment lined baking sheet to set.Melt the remaining  cup dark chocolate in the microwave and transfer to a small piping bag or ziplock bag with the corner snipped off. Drizzle the chocolate over the bars.Store leftovers in the refrigerator or freezer - theyre delicious frozen!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350F.
