Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high, or place a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat.                                                                 2. Spread the butter over each of the peach halves.                                                                3. Grill the peaches, flat sides down, until warmed through, about 4 minutes.                                                                 4. Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil. Pour in the sugar and honey and stir until all the sugar has dissolved.                                                                5. Serve the peach halves with generous spoonfuls of the ricotta in the centers, and drizzled with the sugar syrup.                                                Tip:             For an even simpler version, top the peaches and ricotta with some drizzles of honey and a bit of cracked black pepper instead of the sugar syrup.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high, or place a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404648,"name":"grill pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill-pan.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Spread the butter over each of the peach halves.","ingredients":[{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Grill the peaches, flat sides down, until warmed through, about 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Pour in the sugar and honey and stir until all the sugar has dissolved.","ingredients":[{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Serve the peach halves with generous spoonfuls of the ricotta in the centers, and drizzled with the sugar syrup.","ingredients":[{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Tip","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For an even simpler version, top the peaches and ricotta with some drizzles of honey and a bit of cracked black pepper instead of the sugar syrup.","ingredients":[{"id":9236,"name":"peach","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/peaches.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
