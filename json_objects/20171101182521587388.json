heat.  Add the onion and garlic with a small pinch of salt and pepper and stir.  Cook for 5-6 minutes until soft and fragrant.  Add the mushrooms, thyme, basil, oregano and black pepper and stir.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to soften.  Add the tomatoes and continue to cook, 5-6 more minutes until the tomatoes break down and the mushrooms are very tender.  Slowly pour in the wine and stir frequently until most of the liquid is evaporated.  Add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, chili powder and granulated sugar and stir well. Adjust the salt and pepper as necessary.  Cover the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally.Serve over the cooked penne.  Cassie's Notes:Feel free to use any mushrooms you have on hand - or a combination of your favorites.  Baby Portobellos are our favorite and we always have them on hand.  I think this would be fabulous with a mix of wild mushrooms!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente.While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onion and garlic with a small pinch of salt and pepper and stir.
