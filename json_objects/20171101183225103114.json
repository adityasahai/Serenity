great choices for Stew. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. You could try La Jota Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 109 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":433478,"title":"La Jota Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"","price":"$109.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433478-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/la-jota-howell-mountain-cabernet-sauvignon-1985/164118"}]},"instructions":"Combine onions, garlic, carrots, celery and pepper in a large bowl. Season the meat with salt and pepper, and toss meat with the vegetables. (Protect yourself from contact with Scotch Bonnet peppers.) Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, (the longer the better).                          Heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan, and add the meat/vegetable mixture, browning all sides of meats and cooking for a few minutes to integrate flavors. Add the tomato paste and stock, cover and reduce heat. Simmer until meat is fork tender, at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours, checking occasionally to make sure there is adequate liquid in the pot. (This recipe is also great cooked slowly in a crock pot.) Once the meat is tender, add the chopped tomato and parsley and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine onions, garlic, carrots, celery and pepper in a large bowl.
