Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/attems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014/160114"}]},"instructions":"Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 8 minutes.                          Add 1/2 cup water, the wine and red pepper flakes to the pot and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels and tilapia; cover and cook until the mussels open and the tilapia is cooked through, about 5 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Season with salt and pepper. Gently stir in the parsley.                          Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Broil until toasted, about 3 minutes. Serve with the seafood stew.
