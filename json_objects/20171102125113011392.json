A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Heat a pot of water on the stove to very hot (just under a simmer).In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine ¾ cup of the granulated sugar, flour, ¼ cup of the cocoa, baking powder and salt.  Stir in milk, melted butter and vanilla and mix until smooth.Pour the batter into an ungreased 2-quart dish (as shown in our photos) or a 9-inch square baking pan and spread evenly.  In a small bowl, stir together the remaining ½ cup granulated sugar, brown sugar, remaining ¼ cup cocoa and mix well.  Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the batter in your dish or pan. Pour the hot water over the top – but do not stir!Bake 35-40 minutes if using a dish (or 30-35 minutes if using the 9x9 pan) – or until the center is almost set.  Remove your dish from the oven and allow it to stand for 15 minutes.After 15 minutes, spoon the cake into individual serving bowls – making sure to spoon the fudgy sauce from the bottom of the pan over the top of the cake.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a pot of water on the stove to very hot (just under a simmer).In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine ¾ cup of the granulated sugar, flour, ¼ cup of the cocoa, baking powder and salt.
