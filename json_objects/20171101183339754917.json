Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Directions1) Toast hazelnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes.2) Cook pasta in salted water until done (about 1 tablespoon kosher salt per gallon).3) Meanwhile wash spinach well.4) Stir together mascarpone, lemon juice, salt, and nutmeg.5) When pasta is done, reserve about 1 1/2 cups of the pasta water.6) Drain pasta and then add pasta back to pan. Pour over mascarpone sauce as well as about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
