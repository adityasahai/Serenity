Coat a skillet with oil and put over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic, cook, stirring, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and herbs and saute for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushrooms to a glass bowl, grate in the zest of a lemon, then cover with plastic wrap to infuse the flavor. Set aside.                          Heat the chicken broth in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat. Melt butter in the skillet and stir in the flour to make a roux. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the warm stock and stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Continue for 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened and smooth. Add the egg, milk, reserved mushrooms, and turkey. Cook and stir until heated through, do not let boil. Fold in the cooked noodles and mix to combine.                          Spoon the mixture into a buttered 9 by 13-inch baking pan and smooth out with a spoon. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and Parmesan. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F until the sauce bubbles and a top crust has formed, 20 to 30 minutes. Garnish with toasted almonds before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Coat a skillet with oil and put over medium heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add shallot and garlic, cook, stirring, until translucent, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11677,"name":"shallot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shallots.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the mushrooms and herbs and saute for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned.
