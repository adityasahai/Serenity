Mix well to blend. Working one at a time, place an egg roll wrapper on a work surface with a pointed end toward you. Place about ¼ cup of filling in the bottom center of the wrapper. Fold the tip closest to you over the filling, then roll once. Fold the sides in over the filling and continue rolling until a small area of the last point is left. Dip a finger in water and use it to moisten the remaining point. Roll tightly to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.Heat oven to 425º. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the egg rolls, seam side down, onto the baking sheet. Lightly mist the tops of the egg rolls with cooking spray. Bake for about 15 minutes, turning halfway through baking to brown both sides. Serve warm with your choice of dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine all the ingredients for the filling in a large bowl.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix well to blend.
