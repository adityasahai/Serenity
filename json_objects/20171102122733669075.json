White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try District 7 Estate Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"First, make your dough. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, pepper and dill.Then add in eggs, olive oil and water and use a large spoon to combine into a dough. You can also use a dough hook on a stand mixer to make the dough.Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour as needed so dough is tacky but not super sticky. Dough should be smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.Meanwhile, make your filling!First, caramelize your onion. This is going to take awhile, so be patient! Heat a large, saut pan over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat. Then add onions and  teaspoon salt and brown, stirring occasionally so they don't burn. If the onions start to stick, add a little water to the pan. After 10 minutes or when onions start to get nice and caramel, lower heat to medium. Cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, or until onions are very brown and have reduced down to about  cup. Optional, you can add 2 tablespoons dry white wine to deglaze the pan towards the end. Stir the wine until it evaporates, while scraping up the tasty bits on the bottom of the pan.Set onions aside and clean the pan (or use a new pan). Heat over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat. Season chicken well with salt and pepper and saut until cooked through, about 7-8 minutes.Add caramelized onions, chicken, garlic clove and 1 tablespoon broth to a food processor. Pulse until you have a well chopped filling but not a paste. It should be moist, but not too wet or dry. Add more broth if it's dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (If you don't have a food processor, you can do this by chopping the chicken and onions very fine by hand and then mixing in minced garlic, broth and salt and pepper.)Now it's time to assemble! Bring a large pot of chicken broth or salted water to a simmer.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin to  thick or even thinner depending on your preference. I like mine on the thicker side. Cut into 3 inch squares and add 1 teaspoon filling to one corner. Fold in half and use water to help seal so no there are no leaks. Depending on how thin you roll the dough, you may have extra filling. Eat with crackers or on a sandwich!Simmer kreplach for 20 minutes or until tender (less for thiner dough). (Don't overcrowd the pot, you may have to do this in batches.) Serve as is or in soup! Alternatively, you can fry in oil (I use grape seed oil.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, make your dough.
