Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. When it reaches a boil, add the pasta, and continue to let it boil for 7-10 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Drain the cooked pasta in a colander.While waiting for the pasta to cook, prepare the (not) Sun Dried Tomat Sauce according to the directions here. Once the sauce is finished, add the fresh spinach, stir, and cook it over low until the spinach wilts (1-2 min.). Drain the artichoke hearts, roughly chop them, and then add them to the skillet with the tomato sauce and spinach.Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it to the skillet with the sauce, and stir until everything is coated and combined. Serve hot with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over top if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat.
