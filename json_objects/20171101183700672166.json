White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics. The artful combination of these three regions delivers baked apple, pear and lemon cream flavors, accented by an elegant finish of sweet vanilla.","price":"$26.65","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428231-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Pines-Sonoma-Monterey-Chardonnay/dp/B01A8WOKCS"}]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, hot sauce, honey and a couple of cracks of black pepper. Add the chicken wings and toss around to make sure they’re fully covered in the marinade. If you have time, leave the wings to marinate for a couple of hrs in the fridge or ideally overnight.Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Drain and reserve the marinade, then spread the wings out on a very large baking tray. Bake for 30 mins, then pour off the excess oil, add the reserved marinade and toss well. Increase oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Return to the oven and cook for a further 30 mins, tossing a few times to coat in the glaze as they cook. They should be sticky and glazed with most of the marinade evaporated. Serve on a large platter alongside other party snacks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, hot sauce, honey and a couple of cracks of black pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":6971,"name":"worcestershire sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":2048,"name":"apple cider vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":1052047,"name":"celery salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":6168,"name":"hot sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/paprika.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chicken wings and toss around to make sure they’re fully covered in the marinade.
