Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          In a baking dish or sheet pan, toss the carrots, beets and bok choy in 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until the vegetables have caramelized and turned golden in color, about 20 minutes. Let cool.                          Meanwhile, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar and raspberry vinegar in a small mixing bowl. Season the dressing with salt and pepper and reserve for later use.                          Chop the bok choy into 1-inch pieces and toss into a large mixing bowl; the leaves will fall apart, but crumble them into the mixing bowl too. Add the carrots, beets, quinoa, cranberries, pepitas, parsley and orange segments to the mixing bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss to evenly incorporate. Season with salt and pepper. Top with the crumbled goat cheese and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"In a baking dish or sheet pan, toss the carrots, beets and bok choy in 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11116,"name":"bok choy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bok-choy.jpg"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carrots.jpg"},{"id":11080,"name":"beet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beets.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Bake until the vegetables have caramelized and turned golden in color, about 20 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Let cool.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Meanwhile, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar and raspberry vinegar in a small mixing bowl.
