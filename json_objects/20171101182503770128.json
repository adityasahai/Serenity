In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Working one at a time, brush wonton wrapper with egg wash; place string cheese in the center of each wrapper. Bring the bottom edge of the wrap tightly over the cheese, rolling from bottom to top until the top of the sheet is reached, being careful not to tear the wrapper. Repeat with remaining wrappers and string cheese. Add string cheese to the skillet and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
