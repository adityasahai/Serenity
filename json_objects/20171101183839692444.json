Meanwhile, in a small bowl, using a fork, whisk together cream cheese, powdered sugar and milk until well blended. Drizzle or pipe icing over oatmeal (if you'd like to make the swirl as I did in the photos just make an light indentation in oatmeal with a chopstick, when it has cooled slightly, then pipe icing into indentation).  Sprinkle lightly with additional cinnamon if desired.  Serve warm. Additional serving suggestion: if you like chopped pecans or raisins in your cinnamon rolls feel free to sprinkle some in.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large microwave safe bowl, combine oats, milk, water, brown sugar, cinnamon, molasses, and salt.
