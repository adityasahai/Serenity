A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Put the potatoes and 1 tablespoon water in a large microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap and pierce a few times with a knife to vent. Microwave until very tender, 10 to 13 minutes. Meanwhile, generously butter an 8-inch-round cake pan; sprinkle in 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs and shake to coat, then tap out the excess.                          Add 4 tablespoons butter and the parmesan to the potatoes; season with salt and pepper and mash. Gradually mash in the beaten eggs. Spread half of the mixture in the prepared pan; top with the provolone, peppers and parsley, leaving a 1-inch border. Top with the remaining potato mixture and smooth evenly. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs. Dot with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter.                          Set the pan on the hot baking sheet and bake until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edge to loosen, then unmold. Let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, toss the salad greens, olive oil and lemon juice in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Serve with the potato cake.
