Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and let it sit until it begins to get foamy. About 5 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the butter, sugar, salt, and egg. Fit the mixing bowl onto the mixer with the dough hook. With the mixer on the lowest setting, pour in the milk/yeast mixture and the flour. Increase speed to medium and let the dough knead for about 5 minutes until it forms a soft sticky dough. The mixture will seem quite wet at first, but will form a smooth soft dough once kneaded in the mixer for the full time. If the mixture is too wet after kneading, add more flour 1 TBSP at a time until a soft but sticky dough forms. Place the dough in a clean bowl with a towel or loose plastic wrap over it and allow to rise to double in size. About 1 1/2 hours.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Warm the milk to 105-110ºF. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and let it sit until it begins to get foamy.
