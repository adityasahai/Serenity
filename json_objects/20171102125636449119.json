The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439017,"title":"Cecchi Sangiovese di Toscana","description":"The red wine is made according to traditional methods, along with the help of modern technology and with much care. It has a ruby red colour with purple lights, and a delicate fruity bouquet reminiscent of violets and irises. Its good structure, well combined with a moderate acidity, can be distinguished on the palate. Although lacking in sharp tannins, the generous taste of the Sangiovese guarantees a wine that ages well. This wine is pleasant with cold and hot meat dishes and when young should be served at a temperature of 16 °C.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439017-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/cecchi-sangiovese-di-toscana-2000/48873"}]},"instructions":"Preheate oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 10\" pie dish with PAM cooking spray and set aside.Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water for a few seconds.Stir together eggs, parmesan cheese, and ½ c. marinara sauce until well combined. Stir in drained pasta until evenly coated. Pour pasta mixture into prepared pie dish, and press evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan to form the crust.Spray a 12\" skillet with PAM and heat over medium-high heat. Add sausage, and brown and crumble meat until cooked through. Add spinach, and stir and saute until spinach is completely cooked and wilted. Drain meat and spinach mixture very well. (The draining step is important! Too much liquid will cause the crust to fall apart.)Return the meat and spinach to the skillet or a large mixing bowl, and stir in ricotta cheese. Spread sausage mixture evenly into pasta crust.Spread remaining 1½ c. marinara (or as much as sauce as you like) over the sausage, and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.Sprinkle cheese evenly over the top, and bake an additional 8-10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.
