White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate.

The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"For the Chicken:Preheat oven to 350ºF. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. Heat half of the olive oil and butter in a heavy bottomed skillet (I like to use my cast iron skillet) over medium high heat. While pan is heating, season both sides of the chicken with a sprinkle of salt & pepper and then dredge in flour, being sure to shake off the excess flour. When pan is hot, add half of the chicken (not over-crowding the pan) and sear on both sides until golden brown (about 2-3 minutes each side). Place seared chicken on prepared baking sheet and then repeat process with second half of chicken (using the remaining oil and butter). Remove to baking sheet when seared on both sides. Place baking pan into the oven until all of the chicken cutlets are cooked completely through, a minimum of 165ºF at the thickest part (should only take about 7-10 minutes). Note: Prepare sauce while chicken is cooking. When chicken is cooked through, remove from oven and add 1 slice of Mozzarella cheese to each piece. Return to oven until just melted. For the Sauce:While chicken is cooking, in the same skillet you browned the chicken (NOTE: DO NOT WASH OR WIPE OUT PAN - The browned bits add flavor to the sauce), add an additional tablespoon each of butter and olive oil. Add the mushroom and quickly saute until softened (2-3 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for 30 more seconds, stirring constantly. Next, add 3 tablespoons of flour and stir until mixture is coated. Cook for 30-45 seconds, stirring constantly. Next add the wine and chicken broth to the pan, stir well, and bring to a boil. Cook until mixture reduces and thickens up a bit (5-10 minutes). Season with salt and pepper and serve over chicken.Goes great with Oven Roasted Asparagus and Creamy Mashed Red Potatoes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Chicken:Preheat oven to 350ºF.
