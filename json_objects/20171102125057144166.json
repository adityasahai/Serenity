Feel free to also add more sugar or spices to taste.When cider is ready allow to cool then strain apple pieces and whole spices into a clean pitcher or pot. If you feel like it you can strain everything through a cheesecloth and twist and squeeze to get every last drop.Serve hot, and garnish with a cinnamon stick, fresh orange slice, or dried apples if you'd like.
