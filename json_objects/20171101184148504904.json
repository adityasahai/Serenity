In large bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat sugar with butter until creamy. At low speed, beat in egg, vanilla, cinnamon, and cardamom until mixed. Gradually beat in flour mixture just until combined.Divide dough in half; shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk with plastic wrap and refrigerate about 1 hour or until firm enough to roll. (Or, place dough in freezer 30 minutes.)Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Place dough (see bottom for recipe) on a floured surface with floured rolling pin. Roll 1 disk of dough into 10-inch by 7 1/2-inch rectangle. Remove edges with a sharp knife, to create a perfect rectangle.With a sharp knife, cut rectangle lengthwise into 4 strips. Then cut each strip crosswise into 3 squares. Place squares, 1 inch apart, on a parchment paper lined large cookie sheet. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon Nutella in center of each square. With knife, make a cut from each corner toward center (do not cut all the way to center). Fold every other tip in to center to form pinwheel.Repeat with remaining squares. Bake cookies 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.  Remove from oven. At this point, if you would like to create a hole for a ribbon, using a straw, press it into the thicker part of one of the wheels of the pinwheel. The actual cookie will stay inside of the straw, leaving a perfect hole for ribbon. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"On a sheet of waxed paper, stir flour, baking powder, and salt.
