Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maso Canali Pinot Grigio. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes.

Let sit for at least 30 minutes, tossing occasionally. (The onions will turn bright pink.) Strain.                          Cook the eggs and peas: Put the eggs in a medium saucepan, and add water to cover by an inch. Bring to a boil, add the peas, cover and remove from heat. Let sit for 10 minutes. Run the eggs and peas under cold water to cool. Remove the eggshells and roughly chop the eggs.                          Make the dressing: Pulse the milk, cream cheese, mayonnaise, remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth. Pour the mixture into a small bowl, and stir in the sesame seeds, poppy seeds and onion flakes. Refrigerate the dressing, covered, until ready to serve.                          Assemble the salads: Using four 32-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids, evenly divide the radishes among the jars, then add the following in separate layers: the arugula, sprouts, smoked salmon, peas, chopped eggs and pickled onions. Pack the dressing and bagel chips (1 serving is about 1/3 cup dressing and 1/2 cup chips) in separate small containers for transporting.                          Just before serving, transfer the jarred ingredients to a large bowl, add the bagel chips, toss with the dressing and season with salt and pepper.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: Four 32-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Make pickled onions: Toss the onions with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and cold water and a large pinch of salt in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Let sit for at least 30 minutes, tossing occasionally.
