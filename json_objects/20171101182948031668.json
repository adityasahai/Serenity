Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432105,"title":"Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Aromas of apricot, guava and pineapple juice mingle with hints of sweet vanilla and warm toasty notes.","price":"$35.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/432105-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Estates-Vineyard-Reserve-Chardonnay/dp/B01IFNU7ZG"}]},"instructions":"If using wooden skewers, soak in water for at least one hour.In a small sauté pan over medium heat, dry roast coriander, peppercorns and sesame seeds.  Shake the pan often and cook for 2-3 minutes or just until you see a bit of smoke.  Remove immediately to cool. If you have a small food processor, like this one, process toasted spices until finely crushed.If not, lay the toasted spices out in a sheet tray and crush with the bottom of a heavy skillet. Set aside for serving.Combine the soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and sriracha. Set aside for serving.In a large bowl, combine chicken, scallions, ginger and sesame seed oil. Toss well.Begin threading chicken, peppers and onions on skewers alternately. Either end should have chicken or onion as the pepper will slip off at the ends. The onion should be pierced straight through each layer so it stays on the skewer as it cooks. Pour any leftover ginger mixture over the skewers. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over each skewer.Over a medium grill, oil the grates with an oil soaked paper towel.  Grill the skewers about 5-7 minutes per side and remove when the chicken is done and the vegetables are tender. Pull open the largest piece of chicken to test for doneness. It should be cooked through. Grill the lime wedges if desired to add char marks. Place the skewers on a platter and sprinkle with the spice shake on all sides and garnish with the grilled lime wedges.  (Save any leftover spice shake for other grilled recipes.) Serve over white Basmati rice, along with the dipping sauce and a grilled lime wedge.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If using wooden skewers, soak in water for at least one hour.In a small sauté pan over medium heat, dry roast coriander, peppercorns and sesame seeds.
