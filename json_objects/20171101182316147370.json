Meanwhile, kill each lobster by pressing the tip of a heavy chef's knife in the crack just behind the eyes in the center of the carapace. Press down firmly, then split head in half. Using kitchen towels, twist off tail and claws (including knuckles) from carapace. Save carapace for another use. Press each tail flat against the cutting board and insert wooden skewers along their entire length to keep them straight.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Set a wire rack in a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet. Place a steamer insert in the bottom of a large lidded stock pot and add 1-inch of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add a single layer of lobster claws and legs (about half the lobster) and cover pot. Let steam for exactly two minutes, then transfer to rack set in baking sheet (lobsters may still be twitching slightly—this is a reflex reaction. Don't worry, they are dead). Repeat with remaining lobster.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer to oven and roast until claws reach 135°F in the center  as measured on an instant-read thermometer, about 7 minutes. Remove claws and set aside on large plate. Continue roasting until tails reach 135°F in center, 7 to 15 minutes longer (depending on exact shape of tails).
