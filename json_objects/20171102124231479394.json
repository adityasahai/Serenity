Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir.

Take the color and scent of a Guinee rose, add fruit aromas of black cherry and marion berry with spice aromas of turned earth and dark cocoa and you just begin to approach the complexity of this wine. \"Ripe and generous, with distinctive violet and rose petal overtones to the cherry and spice flavors, lingering with fine texture. Needs time to settle in. Twenty percent of the wine will be bottled under screw cap. The wine bottled under screw cap scored 92 points.
