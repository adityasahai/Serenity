Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430702,"title":"District 7 Estate Chardonnay","description":"Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6"}]},"instructions":"Heat a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Whisk together the sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, chili powder, ground mustard, salt and pepper. Rub it all over the chicken. Add the olive oil and butter to the skillet. Place the chicken in the oil once hot and brown on both sides until deeply golden, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. I sometimes cover the skillet while doing this and it helps cook the chicken through.Once browned, remove the chicken and shred it (I use my stand mixer). Return the chicken to the skillet with the drippings and toss well to coat. Stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons BBQ sauce. Serve the chicken on the brioche with extra BBQ sauce and apple slaw.pomegranate BBQ saucePlace all ingredients in a saucepan and whisk together until combined. Heat oven medium heat and bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat and cook for 30 to 60 minutes, until thickened. Stir occasionally. Taste and if it seems too tart, stir in a little extra honey and cook for a few minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit at room temperature until it cools and thickens even more.Store in a jar or sealed container in the fridge. Note: if you want a lot of extra sauce, I'd double this. apple slawToss the apple, scallions, cabbage and cilantro together in a bowl. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar and honey. Drizzle it over the slaw and toss well to evenly coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss again.
