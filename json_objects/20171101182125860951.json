After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/robert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999/51817"}]},"instructions":"The night before, rub mustard all over roast and generously sprinkle with your rub.

Let it heat up high and once the fire calms down, move the coals to one side of the grill. Place the pork on the side of the grill without the charcoal. Cover the grill and cook until the pork reaches 150 degrees (about 3 hours).Take the pork off the grill and cover for 20 minutes so the juice runs back into the meat. Cut into slices and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The night before, rub mustard all over roast and generously sprinkle with your rub. I used about 1/4 cup.
