Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Add egg and vanilla, and mix until combined, about 1 minute.In a separate bowl, whisk togetherthe flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cornstarch and salt until combined. Add in this flour mixture gradually to the butter mixture, and mix on medium-low speed until combined. Add the oats, and continue mixing on medium-low speed until combined. If you are using any add-ins (up to 2 cups), fold them in on low-speed untiljust combined.

Chill in the refrigerator for at least 10-20 minutes.Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges are just set and are lightly golden. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.Serve immediately or store in a sealed container for up to 1 week.
