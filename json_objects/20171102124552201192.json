A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Set aside.Place the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.Add the butter and half the banana mixture. Mix on medium speed until well combined, about 90 seconds.Scrape the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl, add the remaining banana mixture, and beat for about 30 seconds more.Divide the batter equally between each of the wells of the pan. Bake for 28-32 minutes, or until the cake springs back when pressed lightly. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean or with one or two moist crumbs. Cool completely.Place the strawberries in a mini chopper, food processor, or blender, and puree until smooth. Set aside.Place the egg whites and sugar in a large metal or glass mixing bowl, and whisk to combine.Place the bowl over a small pot of simmering water, and cook, whisking occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture no longer feels grainy when rubbed between the thumb and forefinger.Remove the bowl from the heat and whip on high speed until no hint of warmth is left when you feel the side of the bowl.Whip in the butter, one tablespoon at a time. If the mixture looks curdled, continue to whip until it comes back together, before adding more butter. If it seems runny, place it in the fridge for 5 minutes and then whip some more.When the mixture is thick and fluffy, add in the pureed strawberries. Whip on high speed until the frosting is fluffy and smooth.Spoon a little pineapple into the wells of each mini bundt. Top with strawberry buttercream. Drizzle with chocolate sauce, sprinkle with nuts, and place a cherry on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and lightly mist a mini bundt pan with non-stick spray.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404748,"name":"kugelhopf pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bundt-cake-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the banana, Greek yogurt, egg, and vanilla in a mini chopper, food processor, or blender, and puree until smooth.
