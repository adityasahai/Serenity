Pour in the egg replacer and a quarter of the milk. Use an electric whisk to thoroughly combine the mixture. Pour in another quarter and whisk until lump free, then mix in the remaining milk. Leave to rest for 20 mins. Stir again before using.Heat a small non-stick frying pan with a knob of butter. When the butter starts to foam, pour a small amount of the mixture into the pan and swirl around to coat the base – you want a thin layer. Cook for a few mins until golden brown on the bottom, then turn over and cook until golden on the other side. Repeat until you have used all the mixture, stirring the mixture between pancakes and adding more butter for frying as necessary. Serve with orange segments and a drizzle of agave syrup or the pancake filling of choice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the centre.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour in the egg replacer and a quarter of the milk.
