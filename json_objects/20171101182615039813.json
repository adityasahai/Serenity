Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":469199,"title":"Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay","description":"We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless.

I prefer a charcoal kettle barbecue, with the coals swept to one side for both direct and indirect heat.Preheat an oven to 350F and toast hazelnuts for 6-7 minutes or until light golden. Watch them closely so that they do not burn. Cool, and rub lightly with your fingertips to remove the skins. Reserve.Make the dressing by combining the plan yogurt, minced garlic and lemon juice together in a blender. Add about a tablespoon each of chopped mint and basil, along with half (1/4 cup) of the olive oil and preserved lemon, if using. Blend until smooth, then stop and scrape down the sides. Add the salt and pepper to the dressing. Drizzle in the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil with the blender running. Transfer to a small bowl or jar for holding.Slice the zucchini into 1/4-inch lengths. Grill on the hottest part of the coals, using a long-handled pair of tongs to turn the slices. Grills and temperatures will vary, but about a minute per side. Remove from heat before the zucchini gets too soft.Arrange charred zucchini on a serving platter and top generously with yogurt dressing. Sprinkle the hazelnuts and feta cheese on top. Tear a few generous handfuls of both mint and feta apart and sprinkle onto the salad just before serving.Serve warm, with additional dressing as a side condiment.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a grill to 400F.
