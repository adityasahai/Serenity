Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus. The natural acidity gives this wine a perfect balance that is refreshingly crisp and leaves your mouth watering. A perfect party wine, or can be enjoyed with a variety of foods from seafood and poultry to oriental food and fresh salads.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434166-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/schmitt-sohne-relax-riesling-2008/99841"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 325F. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Brown the chops on both sides, working in two batches to avoid crowding the pan (if you do, they will steam rather than brown). Transfer browned chops to a 9x13\" baking dish.Melt butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally until browned and most of the moisture has been released, about 7 minutes. Stir in onions and cook until soft, about 6 minutes more. Add garlic and cook one minute more. Stir in flour; cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add milk a bit at a time, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.Pour mushroom sauce over pork chops and bake 1 hours, until pork is tender. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
