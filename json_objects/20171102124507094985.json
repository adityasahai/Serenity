In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. You could try Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435555,"title":"Columbia Winery Cellarmaster's Riesling","description":"The Columbia Valley Cellarmaster's Riesling is sweet and beautifully balanced with classic floral aromas. This wine is almost clear in color, as Rieslings have very little pigment and are generally tank fermented. Flavors of juicy tropical fruit, peach and freshly squeezed lime create a zippy natural acidity.This wine pairs well with spicy Szechuan and Thai dishes, as well as glazed ham.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435555-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/columbia-winery-cellarmasters-riesling-2011/126977"}]},"instructions":"1 Put the canola oil in a 9 or 10 inch cast iron skillet and place the skillet in the oven. Heat oven to 400°F with the skillet inside. 2 In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking soda and salt.   3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, milk, and egg. Pour into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir to combine. Stir in the melted butter, the chopped jalapeños, corn, and cheese.4 Once the oven has reached 400°C and the skillet is hot, carefully remove the empty skillet from the oven (double up the pot holders, the handle is hot!).  Pour the cornbread batter into the skillet, and smooth the surface with a wooden spoon or spatula. 5 Return the skillet to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned on top and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.6 Let the jalapeño cornbread rest in the skillet for 10 to 20 minutes before cutting wedges and serving. Remember that the skillet is still very HOT. I recommend keeping a pot holder draped over the handle, or rubbing the handle with ice to cool it down. (I've burned my hand picking up a hot skillet; it's no fun.)Serving tip - drizzle with honey! There's plenty of butter in the batter, none extra needed.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the canola oil in a 9 or 10 inch cast iron skillet and place the skillet in the oven.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"canola oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat oven to 400°F with the skillet inside. 2 In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking soda and salt.   3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, milk, and egg.","ingredients":[{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornmeal.jpg"},{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-cream.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir to combine.
