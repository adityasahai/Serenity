A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Make sure to grease your dish before adding the cake batter.  My cake baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 23 minutes.  Allow cake to cool to room temperature.Meanwhile, toast the coconut on an un-greased baking sheet at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes.  Stir it up, and then continue baking and stirring every 30 seconds to 1 minute or until golden brown.  Coconut browns and burns quickly, so stay right by the oven and stir it frequently.  Allow the toasted coconut to cool.Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the cooled cake.  Open the can of Cream of Coconut, empty it into a 2-cup measuring glass and heat it for 15 seconds in the microwave.  Whisk the mixture well and then pour it all over the cake and into the holes.  Allow the cake to soak up all of the Cream of Coconut, about 5 to 10 minutes.Frost the cake with cool whip and sprinkle the top with the toasted coconut.  Cut and serve immediately.  Keep leftovers refrigerated.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare and bake the cake according to the directions on the box for a 9x13-inch pan.
