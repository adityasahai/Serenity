baking soda, and salt. Set aside.In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat together the sugar and egg until pale and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Beat in the buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla, nutmeg, and lemon zest until combined. Slowly beat in half of the flour mixture. Turn off the mixer. Finish stirring in the rest of the flour by hand with a wooden spoon just until the dough comes together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 350F. Line a plate or baking sheet with a triple layer of paper towels. Set aside.On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out doughnuts using a 2.5-inch doughnut cutter. After cutting out as many as you can, gather up the scraps, create a new dough ball, then roll out. Repeat until all of the dough is gone.Fry the doughnuts only a few at a time (do not overcrowd the fryer) until lightly brown on one side, about 1 minute. Flip and cook for another minute. Remove from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat until all of the doughnuts are done. Let cool completely.For the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice. After the doughnuts are completely cooled, dunk the tops of each one into the glaze. Alternatively, you can spoon or brush the glaze onto each one. Repeat until all of the doughnuts are glazed.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, whisk together both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
