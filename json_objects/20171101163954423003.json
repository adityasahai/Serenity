Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).2. Prick the squash with a fork and place it whole on a baking sheet. Roast until the squash has softened, about 45 minutes. Set the squash aside until cool enough to handle, then cut it in half and scoop out the seeds. Turn each squash half over onto a cutting board and run a vegetable peeler over the curved sides to remove the peel. Cut the squash into 2-inch chunks.3. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the butter starts to brown, add the onion and saute until it is translucent and begins to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.4. Add the honey to the onions and cook until it bubbles. Add the squash chunks and sage and season with salt and pepper.5. Add the chicken stock and enough water to cover the squash by an inch. Bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer the soup until the onions and squash are very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add more liquid if necessary to keep the squash submerged. Remove the pan from the heat and cool for 15 minutes.6. Purée the butternut squash soup in a blender until smooth. (Don’t fill the blender more than two-thirds full.) Strain through a coarse strainer if you want a smoother soup or if you prefer a more rustic soup return the purée to the pan without straining. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the finished soup back to a boil. Ladle it into bowls and serve with a small dribble of crème fraîche, about 1 tablespoon per bowl.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).2.
