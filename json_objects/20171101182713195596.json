Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Boil the pasta until al dente.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan, and add the asparagus, garlic and corn. Cook for 5 minutes over a medium heat, then turn the heat down a little and add the tomatoes and artichokes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes, until the tomatoes have begun to break down and the vegetables are all fully heated through. Season to taste, and add the fresh chives.When the pasta is ready, drain it, and add it to the pan with the vegetables. Mix to combine. If you think it needs it, add a tablespoon or so of the oil from the artichokes - mine was actually fine without this addition. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil the pasta until al dente.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan, and add the asparagus, garlic and corn.
