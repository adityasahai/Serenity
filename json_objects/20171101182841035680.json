Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

Transfer to a bowl to cool.Peel the rough skin from the beets with a vegetable peeler. If you have a mandoline, use it to slice the beets into thin matchsticks (watch your fingers!). If you don't have a mandoline, hold onto the rough end of the beet and slice the beet into super thin rounds, starting at the tip and working your way to the rough top. Discard the rough top. Working in batches, stack the rounds on top of each other and slice them into long, thin matchsticks.In a medium-sized serving bowl, combine the beets, arugula, crumbled feta and pepitas. Drizzle in just enough dressing to lightly coat the salad once tossed. Toss and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"First, toast the pepitas in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant and making little popping noises, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10012014,"name":"raw pumpkin seeds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer to a bowl to cool.Peel the rough skin from the beets with a vegetable peeler.
