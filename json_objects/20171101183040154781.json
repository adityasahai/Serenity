Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment.

Set aside. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add milk and stir until sauce thickens. Lightly whisk together egg yolks, sugar and salt. Stir a small amount of white sauce into yolks. Add the yolk mixture to the pan. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and fold in beaten egg whites. Divide soufflé mixture between 2 9 inch pans that have been buttered and lined with parchment paper. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until top springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove from pans and peel off paper. Refrigerate. Filling: Beat cream cheese. Add sour cream and lemon juice and beat until smooth. Stir in salmon, scallions, cucumber and dill. Place one soufflé layer on the serving plate. Cover with the filling. Place the second soufflé layer on top. Combine the frosting ingredients. Frost the top of torte. Decorate with salmon shapes if desired. Chill for 1 hour before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff but not dry. Set aside.
