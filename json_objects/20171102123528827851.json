In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":443227,"title":"Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling","description":"The Chateau Ste.

In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, onions, jalapeno and a pinch of salt. Add enough of the buttermilk to make a stiff batter. You may not need the whole 2 cups.                          Heat the peanut oil in a deep fryer or a large heavy bottomed pot to 250 degrees F.                          Drop the batter into the hot oil by teaspoonfuls. The hushpuppies will turn over in the oil as they cook. They are done when they are brown all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and season with salt. Keep the hushpuppies warm while you fry the remaining batter. Serve hot.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, onions, jalapeno and a pinch of salt.","ingredients":[{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cornmeal.jpg"},{"id":11979,"name":"jalapeno pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/jalapeno-pepper.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add enough of the buttermilk to make a stiff batter.
