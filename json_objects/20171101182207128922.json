Melt the butter in a medium non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms release their liquid, the liquid evaporates, and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the shallots and thyme and cook, stirring, until shallots are just beginning to brown, about 3 minutes longer. Add the stock and the Marmite, stirring so that Marmite dissolves into the sauce, then bring to a simmer and cook until the stock has reduced to a saucelike consistency, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Divide the mushrooms between the ramekins, using a spoon to make a well in the center. Break an egg into each well, then place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until eggs have just set, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sliced scallions, season eggs with salt, and serve immediately with bacon and lightly dressed greens on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425°F.
