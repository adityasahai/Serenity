Add the butter and remaining sugar; process until smooth. Blend in one of the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, flour and salt. Set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set to the side.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Roll out one sheet of the puff pastry into an 11-inch square. Keep the pastry cool, do not knead or stretch. Using a cookie or biscuit cutter (I used the \"tartelette mold\" which Williams-Sonoma uses on their gift wrapping), cut out as many rounds as you can from the sheet and lay them on the prepared baking sheet. Mound a bit of almond filling in the middle of each round, leaving about half an inch all around it. If you'd like, put a little prize or bean (something tiny works best) inside of any (or all) of them.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Note: I had some extra filling left even after adding it to all of my prepared rounds of puff pastry. If you have more puff pastry, by all means, make more galettes; the filling also works beautifully stirred into cake batter or sugar cookie dough, or as a filling for crescent rolls.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Roll out a second sheet of the puff pastry and repeat the cutouts, but this time place them on top of the ones with filling. Press down the edges to seal (I used a fork to press down the sides to ensure that they were sealed). Beat the remaining egg with a fork, and lightly brush onto the top of the galettes. Prick several small slits in the top to vent steam while baking.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Bake in a preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until puffy and golden on the sides and top. Try to avoid opening the oven during baking (ideally an oven with a window works best) to ensure that the pastry puffs nicely.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the almond paste into a food processor with about half of the sugar, and process until well blended.","ingredients":[{"id":12071,"name":"almond paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/marzipan-or-almond-paste.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the butter and remaining sugar; process until smooth.
