Preheat your oven to 200 degrees.Place the egg whites in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.Whisk the egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Whisk in the cream of tarter.Increase the speed to medium/high and beat for a few minutes, until soft peaks form.Slowly pour in the superfine sugar and continue to beat on high until stiff peaks form(when you remove the whisk attachment, the whipped egg whites that cling to it should stick straight up and not move or fall when the whisk is turned right side up).Scoop the whipped egg white into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.Pipe 3\" circles 2\" apart from each other on the lined baking sheet. Pipe two rings atop one another  around the perimeter of each circle, forming a nest.Bake the meringues in the preheated oven for about 90 minutes, until the outsides of the meringues are crisp, but not browned. The inside will still be slightly spongy. Turn the oven off and leave the meringues inside until they are completely cooled.Remove from the oven and place on work surface.Fill a piping bag fitted with a round tip with lemon curd mousse and pipe it into the center of each meringue until it just mounds over the top of the nest. Place a spoonful of lemon curd over the top of each mound of mousse.Mix the chopped fruit together in a small bowl. Spoon about 1-2 T. Of fruit over the top of each mousse filled meringue nest. Top each meringue with a mint sprig.Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"FOR THE MERINGUE: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper of a non-stick mat.
