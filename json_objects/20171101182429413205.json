Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Line 20-24 muffins cups with cupcake liners or grease with cooking spray.*In a large mixing bowl, beat together the oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla until the mixture is well combined and pale yellow in color. Stir in the mashed bananas.Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix until fully combined.Divide batter evenly among the prepared pans, filling each three-quarters full. Bake 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, do not over bake. Allow the cupcakes to cool slightly and then transfer the cupcakes to large a rimmed baking sheet. Using a skewer, make holes all over the top of the cupcakes.In a bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, goat milk (or regular milk), sweetened condensed milk and vanilla until combined. Gently pour the milk over each cupcakes, ensuring it gets down into the cupcakes nooks and crannies. You may not need to use all the milk (save any leftover for basting during chill time). Refrigerate for 23 hours or until the milk mixture has been absorbed. During this time, I like to spoon more milk over the cupcakes to make sure they a staying moist and really soaking up all the milk they can.To make the buttercream, Add the butter and 1 to 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the Nutella and vanilla and beat more, scraping down the sides as needed, another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks of white. Add 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream + a pinch of salt and whip the frosting for 2-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. If desired add the remaining tablespoons of the heavy cream (I normally do) and whip until combined. Taste the frosting and add more powdered sugar if you like a sweeter or thicker frosting.Frost the cupcakes generously with the Nutella buttercream. Sprinkle with toasted coconut and decorate as desired. Cakes should be kept in the fridge and brought to room temperature 20-30 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
