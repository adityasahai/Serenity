A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Stir in the apples, to coat.In a mixing bowl, blend the pumpkin, sugars, oil, maple, flaxseed, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the milk beverage, followed by the flour / apple mixture, stirring until just combined.Pour the batter into your prepared pan, leveling out as needed. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the cake has pulled away from the sides and the center springs back when lightly pressed.Let cool completely before cutting, and preferably for several hours or even overnight. The cake will become quite cohesive and the flavors will meld as it sits. Will keep for about 2 to 3 days covered at room temperature, or longer if chilled.If desired, frost before serving.In a chilled mixing bowl, blend the cream cheese alternative, coconut cream, vanilla, and salt until just combined.Beat in the powdered sugar, to taste. I prefer  to 1 cup, but you might like it cheesier or sweeter.If the frosting softens too much, simply cover and chill in the refrigerator. It should be a soft, but thick and spreadable consistency.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 350 and grease a 9-inch baking dish.In a large bowl, whisk together the flour blend, pie spice, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
