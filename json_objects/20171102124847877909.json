In another small bowl, break the eggs and beat them well. Pour the beaten eggs and with the help of a fork, work it into the flour.Mix together to form a soft dough. If you feel that the eggs are not enough to form the dough, add 2-3 tsp of oil to make them come together. Do not knead too hard.Close the bowl with a lid and rest for at least 1/2 hour.After 1 hours, divide the dough into 4-5 ping pong sized balls.Use flour to dust a work surface and roll out the balls into thin sheets as much as you can manage. The thinner the better. The dough will not break or tear, so it will be easy to manage. If you want you can cut them using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife into strips of rectangle or square as you get in the shops.</p><p>Arrange the rolled out sheets on a big plate one next to the other till you complete rolling out all the balls and keep the plate covered with a cloth or plate at all times to prevent the sheets from drying out.For the Vegetable Layer:Chop the onion, garlic finely. Dice the bell peppers. Slice and chop the mushrooms finely. Chop the broccoli florets and keep aside.Cut the tomatoes into two and grate them or quarter them and pulse in a mixie or food processor till they are mashed into big chunks. Do not over process and make them into a puree.Heat a pan with oil. Add garlic and once you get the flavor, add in onions and saut till translucent.Now add in the mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli and mix well. Cook for 2 minutes over low flame or till the vegetables wilt and soften.Now add the grated or processed tomatoes. Add salt, chili flakes, ground pepper and mix well. Let this cook over low flame for 20-30 minutes till they become almost dry. By now the raw smell of the tomatoes would have gone.Just before taking off fire, add in chopped basil leaves, Italian seasoning and mix well. In fact do this 5 minutes before you take off fire. Keep aside for the mixture to cool off.To make Lasagna:Grease either a round or square baking tray with olive oil. I used a round oven proof glass tray.Drop the tomato / pasta sauce and spread all around the bottom of the tray.</p><p>Place a thinly rolled out lasagna sheet. Now place 4-5 tbsp of the vegetable filling and with a spoon spread it all over the sheet covering it completely.</p><p>Now place another sheet to cover the vegetable layer. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously all over, covering the sheet completely.Now place another sheet on top of the grated cheese layer and spread the vegetable filling.Like wise keep on with the layers and end with the sheet over which cheese has been spread out.Preheat oven @ 180 C (350 F) and bake for 20-25 minutes or till the cheese has melted and the top has turned golden brown.Let it cool for 5-10 minutes.
