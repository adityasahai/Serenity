Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Place the orange segments in a bowl and add the vanilla pod to the orange segments and toss to combine.Add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift the flour, baking soda and baking powder, and fold through. Finally add the Greek yoghurt and orange juice and mix until just combined. Place the mixture into a 22cm round non stick spring form tin that has been lined with baking paper and smooth the top.Starting from the outside, place the orange segments in a circle, slightly overlapping, and repeat until the whole cake is covered.

Cool on a wire rack.When the cake is cooled sprinkle with sugar and use a kitchen torch to gently brulee the top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 180 celsius (350 fahrenheit) and place the butter, vanilla seeds, orange zest and brown sugar in a bowl of an electric mixer and cream until pale and golden.","ingredients":[{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":9216,"name":"orange zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-orange.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":180.0,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the orange segments in a bowl and add the vanilla pod to the orange segments and toss to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":1019200,"name":"orange slices","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/orange-slices.png"},{"id":93622,"name":"vanilla bean","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, one at a time, beating well between each addition.
