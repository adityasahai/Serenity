Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The J Vineyards & Winery Pinot Noir with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 48 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428384,"title":"J Vineyards & Winery Pinot Noir","description":"At J, we are devoted to the concept of terroir in the Russian River Valley, and our 2013 J Vineyards Pinot Noir is a reflection of this vintage, the vineyards and our attention to detail in the winery.
