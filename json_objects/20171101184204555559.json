Cover and cook for 4-5 hours on high or 7-8 hours on low. Shred directly in the slow cooker with two forks.Cover a baking sheet with foil and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Use tongs to transfer the meat to the covered baking sheet, letting the extra juice drip off back into the slow cooker before transferring, otherwise you'll have a big mess on your hands. Arrange the meat in an even layer and bake for 15 minutes or until some of the pieces are turning golden brown. Mine actually turned a reddish golden brown, which is fine - the color is from the red peppers. Remove the meat from the oven and gently toss all the pieces with tongs. Drizzle with a little bit of juice from the slow cooker.Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Cut the pineapple into rings and cut each ring in half. When the skillet is hot, add the pineapple slices and \"grill\" them for a few minutes on each side to get a nice golden brown color, or you could grill them for real on the actual grill. Arrange the meat and pineapple on each sandwich bun and sprinkle with a tiny bit of cilantro or parsley for some fresh green color. Use the juice in the slow cooker to re-moisten the meat or give a little extra shine to the pineapple slices.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the pork shoulder, garlic, onion, peppers, jalapeno, pineapple juice, and soy sauce in a slow cooker.
