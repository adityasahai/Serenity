A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Whip until thick. Prepare 12 jumbo cupcake liners and place a gingersnap in the bottom of each. Top the cookie with a spoonful of whipped cream then layer with a second cookie. Repeat until each cupcake liner has four cookies topped with cream. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Refrigerate overnight or for at least 6 hours. When the cupcakes are ready, they will be easy to slice and have a cake-like texture. To make the Salted Caramel Sugar, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour 3/4 cup sugar into a heavy bottomed pan and spread evenly. Heat over medium-low heat, watching constantly and carefully. The sugar will begin to liquefy along the edges first. Watch it carefully as it liquefies, using a high heat spatula to break up any clumps. When it has liquefied completely and resembles a shiny penny in color, remove from heat. Temperature should be about 340 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour evenly onto the prepared parchment paper and sprinkle generously with sea salt flakes. The sugar will have hardened in about 5 minutes, at which point you can crush it up and sprinkle it on top of the cupcakes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer, combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla.
