A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Lightly grease the inside of the pan and wrap the bottom in tin foil.Combine butter, chocolate crumbs and sugar and press into the bottom of the pan and 1\" up the sides.Bake for 12-15 minutes until dry. Set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F.In a small bowl, combine chocolate and cream and microwave on high in 20-30 second intervals, stirring each time, until smooth. Set aside.In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add sugar and beat until smooth.Add yogurt, eggs, vanilla, salt and cocoa and beat until smooth and combined, scraping down sides of the bowl if necessary.Add melted chocolate and beat until combined.Pour onto crust and bake at 275 degrees F for 1.75-2 hours (I bake mine 2 hours exactly), until top appears dry but cheesecake still jiggles when moved. Turn the oven off and let sit in warm oven with the door closed for 20 minutes.Remove to a wire rack on the counter, gently run a knife around the inside of the pan and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until completely chilled (I like to chill overnight).
