and pepper and toss to coat. Set aside for 15 minutes.                          Mix the remaining 1 tablespoon rice wine, the oyster sauce and sesame oil in a large bowl; set the bowl near the stove.                          Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat until very hot, about 1 minute. Add 3 tablespoons peanut oil, then the ginger, garlic and chiles; stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the beef and cook, stirring or shaking the skillet occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the beef with a slotted spoon to the sauce mixture and toss.                          If the pan is dry, add 1 tablespoon peanut oil, then add the onion and stir-fry until just soft, about 2 minutes. Add the bok choy and sugar; stir-fry until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
