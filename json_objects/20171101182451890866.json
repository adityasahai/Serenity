Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":442701,"title":"Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro Chianti Classico","description":"Ruby red with garnet hues. The wine expresses a distinctive Tuscan bouquet of violet, cherry, and plum, with aromas of chocolate and spice. Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, cherry, and ripe plum with intriguing notes of cinnamon and clove. Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. Itâ€™s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011/166890"}]},"instructions":"1. Heat oil in a large saucepan and add bacon. Cook until bacon is crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.2. Add rice to the pan and stir for a minute or two. Add wine and simmer for 2 minutes.3. Now start adding the broth in 1/2 cup increments, letting the rice absorb each half cup of broth before you add the next one. Stir from time to time. All the broth should be added and absorbed in about 25 minutes.4. While the risotto is cooking, poach the eggs by bringing a large deep skillet of water to a simmer. Crack each egg into a small bowl or teacup, then gently slip each one into the water. Cover the skillet, turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the water for exactly four minutes. Then scoop them out with a slotted spoon and put them on a plate.6. Back to the risotto: when the rice is cooked, stir in the butter, bacon and artichoke hearts.  Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.7. Divide the risotto among 6 bowls and top with a poached egg. Break the egg so the yolk spreads into the risotto. Serve at once.  Feel merry.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oil in a large saucepan and add bacon.
