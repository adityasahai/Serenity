Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. One wine you could try is Segura Viudas Brut Reserva Heredad Cava. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 22 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448175,"title":"Segura Viudas Brut Reserva Heredad Cava","description":"Like a rich Chardonnay with bubbles, this limited production Cava rests on an authentic pewter base and comes in a handsome hand-blown bottle emblazoned with a metal crest of the Segura Viudas family.

Place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to cool (this will make peeling them easier). When cool; peel, seed and dice the poblano peppers.                          Dice the onions and bell pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or kettle. Add onions, yellow bell pepper, poblano peppers, pressed garlic, chili powder and ancho chili powder. Saute this mixture until the onions are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the diced chicken breast and continue to cook until chicken is fully cooked, 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of your dice.                          Wash and stem the tomatillos then run them through a food processor until they are pulverized, but still have some texture (you could dice them by hand, but this will leave the tomatillo skins floating around in your finished product). Add the tomatillos and the broth to the chicken and pepper mixture. After this is heated through (about 10 minutes), check the spiciness and, if necessary, add either a finely chopped jalapeno or serrano pepper for more heat (we're looking for a slow, sustained burn, not fire). Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes to meld the flavors. Add the beans and cilantro, cook a final 5 minutes to heat thoroughly and serve with a garnish of cilantro and lime slice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roast the poblano peppers on a grill or under the broiler turning often, until blackened and soft.","ingredients":[{"id":10011333,"name":"poblano pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/poblano-peppers.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to cool (this will make peeling them easier).
