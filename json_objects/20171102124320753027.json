Drain the water using a colander. Set aside until the chicken  broth is ready.Prepping the spices, ginger and onion: In a giant spice strainer (see tips below), combine the cinnamon, star anise, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, cloves andcardamom. Set aside.Cut the ginger root in half. Remove any dirt from one piece, peel it with the edge of a spoon, then thinly slice it.Wash the remaining unpeeled ginger; pat dry.  Peel one whole yellow onion without cutting the stem to make sure the onion  doesn't fall apart in the broth. Place a grill on your stove and char  all the skin of the ginger and onion. Wrap them in aluminum foil. Let  cool for about 10 minutes. Wash the ginger and onion under running tap  water; the blackened skin will come right off. Bruise the ginger using a  hammer to loosen the flesh and help release all its flavor.Caramelizing onions: Slice the rest of the yellow onions. Heat the oil in a pan.  Fry the onions, stirring frequently to prevent the onion from burning,  until the color is evenly golden brown. Transfer to a plate, leaving as much oil as possible in the pan (reserve it for the boiled rice noodles and make flavorful vinaigrette using the remaining oil).Making ph g chicken broth:Wash the chicken carcasses and whole chickens.Fill a large stockpot with 6- quarts of water. Bring  to a roaring boil.Add the sliced ginger, fried onions, whole daikon, carrots, the strainer of spices and the charred  ginger and onion to the pot. Bring the liquid back to a boil. Add the whole  chickens and chicken carcasses to the onion broth. Cook for about 10-12  minutes. Remove the whole chickens from the pot. Let them cool a bit  until you can handle them without discomfort. Make several deep diagonal  incisions throughout the birds' flesh. Place the chickens back in the  broth. Season  with 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil again and cook for another 5  minutes (cook the chicken no more than 15 minutes).Remove the whole chickens again from the broth. Let cool a bit. Shred the meat. Set the meat aside on a platter. Return the chicken carcasses to the pot.Lower the  heat from the pot to a bubbly simmer. Cook for about 2 hours. Regularly skim the  impurities rising to the surface of the broth using a fine mesh strainer. Season with salt, mushroom powder, sugar and MSG if you use it (see tips). Cook for another 30-45 minutes.The chicken broth is ready. Get the rest of the pho preparation ready...Boiling the rice noodles: When you're ready to serve, fill a medium-sized pan with about 2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil. Then place a deep bouillon strainer  (or a large strainer that can fit in the pan) and add a scant cup of  the rice noodles. Wait for the water to come back to a boil (about 1-2  minutes) then cook for about 30-45 more seconds. Lift the strainer,  drain the liquid and transfer the noodles to an individual serving bowl.Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of onion-flavored oil (if used).Repeat the same procedure for  each individual bowl.Assembly time: Line up the serving bowls. Place a  little chopped white onion, some green onions, bean sprouts, mint, basil  and cilantro in each bowl. Add the rice noodles.  Ladle the boiling chicken broth you have prepared into the bowls. Top with chicken pieces.Garnish with more green onions, basil and cilantro. Serve with Sriracha, hoisin sauce, lime wedges and fresh sliced green chiles on the side.Serve immediately.Bon apptit!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepping the rice noodles:Soak the dried rice noodles in a big bowl filled with cold water for about 30  minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":20133,"name":"rice noodles","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-rice-noodles.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain the water using a colander.
