Try pairing with Chenin Blanc, Gewurztraminer, and Riesling. The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. You could try Indaba Chenin Blanc. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435388,"title":"Indaba Chenin Blanc","description":"Chenin Blanc is South Africa's most widely planted varietal and the Cape's signature white. This fresh, vibrant version offers succulent flavors of tropical fruit, melon and pear, backed by bright citrus flavors and a touch of honey.
