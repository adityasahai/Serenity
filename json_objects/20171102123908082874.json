The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. One wine you could try is Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 9 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":434166,"title":"Schmitt Sohne Relax Riesling","description":"Relax Riesling is fermented slightly dry with a wonderful fruity bouquet and intense flavors of apples and peaches with just a hint of citrus. The natural acidity gives this wine a perfect balance that is refreshingly crisp and leaves your mouth watering. A perfect party wine, or can be enjoyed with a variety of foods from seafood and poultry to oriental food and fresh salads.","price":"$9.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434166-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/schmitt-sohne-relax-riesling-2008/99841"}]},"instructions":"Add almond pulp, date paste, carob powder and whey protein to the bowl of your food processor and process until well combined. Add rolled oats, shredded coconut and dried cranberries and mix until just incorporated. Place in the refrigerator and allow to chill for about 15 minutes. While dough is chilling, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 400F. Drop dough by the tablespoonful onto the lined baking sheet (I used a one tablespoon spring action ice cream scoop) Place in the oven and bake for about 8 minutes. The drops will be soft as they come out in the oven. Place them on a cooling rack and start a new batch. You will probably need to cook your drops in 4-6 batches, depending on the size of your baking sheet. Make sure to put the dough back in the refrigerator between batches. Allow the drops to cool completely then transfer them to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 7 days. They also freeze really well and can be eaten straight out of the freezer, so it's no use trying to get away from them!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add almond pulp, date paste, carob powder and whey protein to the bowl of your food processor and process until well combined.","ingredients":[{"id":16055,"name":"carob powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/carob.png"},{"id":1001223,"name":"whey protein powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-protein-powder.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add rolled oats, shredded coconut and dried cranberries and mix until just incorporated.","ingredients":[{"id":9079,"name":"dried cranberries","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dried-cranberries.jpg"},{"id":8120,"name":"rolled oats","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rolled-oats.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place in the refrigerator and allow to chill for about 15 minutes.
