Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448122,"title":"Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris","description":"This wine has beautiful lifted pear and jasmine characters on the nose with some hints of creamy, leesy characters underneath. Whilst the powerful palate is packed with flavor, it also has added complexity and weight as a result of the wild barrel ferment. The wine finishes with lovely crisp natural acidity.","price":"$20.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/448122-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/holm-oak-tasmania-pinot-gris-2015/153527"}]},"instructions":"Fill a large bowl with ice water.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the shrimp.
