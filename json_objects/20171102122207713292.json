Spread the crumbled ramen noodles and sliced almonds out on a baking sheet, and stir a bit to combine. Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the almonds and noodles are slightly toasted and golden. Remove baking sheet, and give the mixture a good stir to toss. Then return it to the oven and toast for an additional 3 minutes. Keep a very close eye on the mixture so that it does not burn. Remove and set aside.)Add ingredients (including the vinaigrette) together in a large bowl, and toss until combined.Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. (This salad is much better eaten the first day, as the noodles lose their \"crunch\" the longer it sits, and the avocado may brown a bit. Still, it's perfectly edible and enjoyable even after a few days!)To Make The Vinaigrette:Whisk all ingredients together until combined.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To Make The Salad(Optional first step","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 425 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Spread the crumbled ramen noodles and sliced almonds out on a baking sheet, and stir a bit to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":6583,"name":"ramen noodles","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ramen.jpg"},{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the almonds and noodles are slightly toasted and golden.","ingredients":[{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Remove baking sheet, and give the mixture a good stir to toss.
