Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.
