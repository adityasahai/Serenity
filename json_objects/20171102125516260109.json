Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Beat in melted baking chocolate and cocoa powder. Beat in flour and baking soda until well blended. Stir in all the chocolate chips and Oreo pieces. Chill dough for at least 1 hour. You can also chill it for about 30 minutes, then scoop balls of dough on the cookie sheets and chill those for about 10 minutes and you’ll net the same result as chilling the bowl of dough for an hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line cookie sheets with parchment or a silpat. Drop cookie dough balls (I used a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop) onto your cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. (The dough does spread). Bake for 8-9 minutes, or until the top just stop looking glossy (you’ll start to smell them too). Cool completely before removing from cookie sheets.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat both sugars, butter, vanilla, and eggs until smooth.
