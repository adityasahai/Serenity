Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel.

Put 1 3/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F) in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside to bloom for about 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.Add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture and mix with the dough hook attachment on the lowest setting until the dough comes together. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until the dough is elastic and smooth (about 8 minutes).Form the dough into a ball, place in a large that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and turn the dough to coat itl. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place until doubled in size (about 30 minutes). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly coat with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.Punch down dough, then turn out onto a floured surface. Knead just until the dough is smooth and springs back when poked (about 1 minute). Divide in dough in half.  Cut each half into 4 pieces and form into round buns.  Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet and cut an X on the top of each bun.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size (15 minutes). Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and bring 6-8 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot over high heat.Stir the baking soda into the boiling water (it will foam up slightly). Add 2 rolls and poach 1 minute per side. Using a slotted spoon, remove the rolls, drain and place on the baking sheet, cut-side up. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining rolls.Bake the rolls until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly on the baking sheet.Grill bratwurst patties according to package directions.  Cut open pretzel bun and add desired toppings, and bratwurst patty.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Buns can be prepared earlier in the day, best when eaten the same day though.
