Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone . There are aromas of mango, pear, orange spice, lemongrass and pineapple. In the mouth, there are flavors of tropical fruit, apples, pears and a nice orange citrus note, balanced with minerality and a wonderful, round finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428373-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fetzer-Vineyards-Valley-Pinot-Grigio/dp/B0725QB94C"}]},"instructions":"SET UP: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Oil a 5-quart baking dish.                          MARINATE THE ZUCCHINI: Thinly slice the zucchini into rounds. Toss with the lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt and a couple turns of pepper. Layer the zucchini in the prepared dish, slightly overlapping the slices; the zucchini should just cover the bottom of the dish.                          PREP THE SALMON: Rub the salmon with the lemon zest, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and a couple turns of pepper. Put the salmon on top of the zucchini, skin-side down. Stir together the butter, olives, and thyme and spread over the salmon. Sprinkle the panko over the olives.                          COOK THE SALMON: Bake the salmon until it's firm and just cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
