Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Trombetta Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 59 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439275,"title":"Trombetta Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"Rich garnet color.

On my electric mixer, I put it on speed 4 for 6-7 minutes and got the soft peaks.In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cream of tartar then with the mixer still running, add one tablespoon of the sugar mixture at a time to the egg whites mixing well between each addition.Turn the speed up to medium and beat for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is thick and glossy.You can test if it's ready for baking by rubbing a little of the meringue batter between your fingers. If it’s smooth, it’s ready, if not, keep beating until it is smooth.In a small bowl, mix the cocoa and cinnamon together and then sift over the meringue.Using a wooden spoon or spatula, fold the cinnamon and chocolate through the meringue. You will have swirls and that's good.Spoon heaping tablespoons of mixture onto the lined baking sheet.Put the baking sheet in the oven.Bake in the middle of oven for 2 hours. Turn off oven and leave the meringues in it for at least 2 more hours or until meringues are completely dry.Store in an airtight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pre-heat the oven to 200F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In your electric mixer, place the egg whites and beat until soft peaks form.
