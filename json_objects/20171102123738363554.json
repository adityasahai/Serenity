Bring to a boil; Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid; set liquid aside to cool to 70°-80°. Mash potatoes; set aside 1 cup to cool to room temperature. (Refrigerate any remaining mashed potatoes for another use.)                                                                                           In bread machine pan, place the milk, eggs, shortening, sugar, salt, bread flour and yeast in order suggested by manufacturer, adding reserved cooking liquid and potatoes. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; some flour may remain on top; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed).                                                                                           When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour if necessary.  Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. doughnut cutter. Place on greased baking sheets; cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 25 minutes.                                                                                           Bake at 350° for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned.  Combine sugar and cinnamon. Brush warm doughnuts with butter; dip in cinnamon-sugar.                                        Yield: about 2-1/2 dozen.
