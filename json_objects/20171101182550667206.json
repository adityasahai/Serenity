and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Sprinkle the coriander, cumin and salt over the chicken, then stir in the yogurt until all the pieces are evenly coated.  Place the chicken in the bottom of a 6-quart slow cooker and put the jalapeno on top of the chicken.To prepare the sauce: Melt butter in a medium saute pan over medium high heat. Add the onions, garlic, and salt, then stir. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to lightly brown around the edges.Stir in the garam masala and ginger and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute) before adding the crushed tomatoes and sugar. Stir well, scraping the caramelized bits from the bottom of the pan, and bring to a boil. Pour the sauce over the chicken in the slow cooker.Cover and cook on low for 5 hours, or until the chicken is very tender.Pour heavy cream into the slow cooker and stir gently until the color is even. Replace the lid and let cook for 10 minutes or until bubbly around the edges.Serve over hot rice topped with a generous amount of chopped cilantro.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To prepare the chicken","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the boneless, skinless chicken thighs into 1- to 1 ½-inch pieces.
