A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Fold in the ground almonds, then fold in the remaining egg whites. Do not over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan and bake until cake surface is puffed and cracked, and center is set (it should barely move when you jiggle the pan), about 40-45 minutes.Let cool in the pan 30 minutes, then remove the springform pan sides and cool completely to room temperature. For a more fudgy texture, chill in the fridge 1-2 hours before serving. Serve with whipped cream, powdered sugar, berries or other desired toppings.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
