Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Butter a 9 by 13 inch pan and line the bottom with parchment. Butter the parchment.In a medium bowl, stir together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and salt. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. I did this by hand but a hand or stand mixer would work as well. Stir in molasses, zest, and eggs, one at a time. Continue mixing until once again light and fluffy. Carefully mix in the boiling water. Gradually mix in the flour mixture, a whisk may be helpful to eliminate lumps. When almost fully mixed, add the crystallized ginger and mix until the batter comes together.Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating halfway through if necessary, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Cool at least 30 minutes in pan; it may be cooled completely in the pan. May be served warm or at room temperature. May be stored at room temperature in a completely air tight container for up to 2 days, or frozen in pieces, wrapped in plastic and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 4 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
