Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly.

(Do not roll those scraps up for cookies as the dough will become too tough.)Bake the cookies for 8 - 9 minutes. Allow them to rest in the baking pan for about 3 minutes and then transfer them to wire racks to cool.Once all cookies are baked, you can then bake the little cut outs, for a shorter time.Once cool, dust the lids (cookies with dough cut out) with confectioners' sugar, if desired.Fill the whole cookies with your favorite jam and top with lid.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium-sizebowl, whiskthe flour blend, baking powder, and salt and set aside.In the bowl of your mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until the butter is lighter in color.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the egg, vanilla and almond extract (if using) and beat until combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1002050,"name":"almond extract","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/extract.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the flour mixture slowly and beat on low speed just until combined.Preheat your oven to 350F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":4,"step":"Roll the dough out onto sheets of parchment paper to about 1/4-inch thick, transfer to cookie sheets and refrigerate for 1 - 2 hours or until firm.(The longer the dough is refrigerated, theless the dough will spread during baking.)","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Cut out the cookies using a heart, star or circle cookie cutter spacing them at least 2-inches apart, and remove the extra dough around the cut out dough.Using a smaller cutter, cut out a smaller but identical shape from half the cookie dough cutouts.Using the scraps, repeat the above process, once.
