White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Set aside to soak while you prepare the other things.Toss the chicken with the BBQ sauce (Tip: I always use leftover chicken for this salad so I lay the chicken pieces on the cutting board, pour the BBQ sauce over the top, and then chop it all together using my knife). Set aside.Chop all your vegetables. Lettuce & greens should be in about 1 - 1½ \" pieces. Dice your tomatoes and cucumbers. Shred your carrots and cheese. If you are using frozen corn, rinse it in a colander to thaw it.Go ahead and build your salads by piling the greens, chopped vegetables, and cheese on each plate (or in a large dish if you are doing family-style).Heat about 1½ cups vegetable oil in a 2 quart saucepan. When a drop of water crackles in the oil it's ready.While the oil heats, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, and salt and spread it out on a plate. Taking several strands of onion rings at a time, dredge them in the flour mixture to coat and then drop them in the hot oil. I do them in several batches, lifting each batch of crispy onion tangles from the hot oil with a fork and placing them on paper towels to drain. Each batch will cook for 1-2 minutes. (SEE NOTE)Place the drained onion tangles on top of each salad. Top with the chicken. Drizzle each salad with the ranch dressing and just a tad more BBQ sauce for serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the onion slices in a medium bowl and pour the buttermilk over them.
