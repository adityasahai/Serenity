A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Lightly grease two 9 inch round layer cake pans.                            Separate eggs reserve 2 of the egg whites for the frosting. Cream shortening, add 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, beaten egg yolks, and 1 egg white; continue beating until well combined.                            Sift flour with baking powder and salt, mix with coconut and add alternately with milk and the almond extract to the shortening mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pans.                            Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Let cakes cool then remove from pans. Ice with Angel icing and sprinkle with shredded coconut on top and sides of cake after icing.                            To Make Angel Icing: Place the 2 egg whites, 3/4 cup white sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar and salt in a double boiler over hard boiling water.  Start beating right away with a beater until the mixture stands in stiff peaks.  Remove from heat and add vanilla or your choice of flavoring and keep beating until it is thick enough to spread easily. Spread over cooled cake.
