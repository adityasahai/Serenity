bowl, using a fork. Set aside.Prepare the seasoning mix: in a small bowl, mix together the kosher salt, oregano, thyme, rosemary and cumin.Prepare the lettuce: wash and dry well. Remove any damaged outer leaves. Cut the lettuce in half, remove the core, and carefully remove the leaves, two at a time, to form the lettuce cups - 2 leaves per cup, nestled within each other. Arrange the lettuce cups on plates, or on a platter.Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the lamb, the onion and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring often and breaking up the meat into small pieces, until meat is browned and onions are tender, about 7 minutes. Drain by pouring the lamb/onion mixture into a colander placed on a bowl, then return to the skillet.Add the seasoning mix. Cook 2 more minutes, stirring and making sure the meat is well-coated with the spices. Turn heat off.Divide the gyro mixture evenly among the lettuce wraps. Top each wrap with a dollop of tzatziki sauce and garnish with tomatoes. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the Tzatziki sauce by combining its ingredients in a small bowl, using a fork.
