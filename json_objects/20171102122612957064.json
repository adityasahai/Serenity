In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":443227,"title":"Chateau Ste.

Place them in a large pot with the bacon, and pour water over the top (1 or 2 inches above the beans). Bring to boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 2 to 3 hours (mine took close to 3). If the liquid appears to be evaporating quickly, add more water as needed during cooking. The beans are done when they're tender but not mushy. Add in salt and pepper. Stir them up and add optional seasonings as desired.For the cornbread: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, salt and baking powder & whisk together. Measure buttermilk and milk in a measuring cup. Stir in the egg with a fork. Add baking soda and stir (it'll bubble a bit). Pour into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir with a fork just until combined. In a small bowl, melt 1/4 cup shortening in the microwave. Slowly add melted shortening to the batter, stirring just until combined. In an iron skillet over high heat, melt the remaining 2 Tbsp. shortening. Pour the batter into the hot skillet and spread to even out the surface. Cook on the stovetop for about a minute, then bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. The edges should be crispy.To serve: Slice the cornbread into squares and serve with the beans and desired garnishes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the beans: Rinse the beans thoroughly and pick out any little rocks or sticks that might have gotten packed into the bag along with the beans.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place them in a large pot with the bacon, and pour water over the top (1 or 2 inches above the beans).
