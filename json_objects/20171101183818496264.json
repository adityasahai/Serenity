Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color.

The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"1.
