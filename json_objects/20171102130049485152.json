the Brownies: Preheat the oven and mix the brownie batter as directed on the package. Use 1-2 eggs to determine a cake-like or fudgy consistency.Spray the inside of the jars with non-stick spray or brush with oil. Measure 1/4 cup batter into each jar. Place all jars on a baking sheet and bake according to package directions, minus 5 minutes. (Usually 30-35 mins.) Test with a toothpick--if it comes out clean, they're done.For the Chocolate Malt Pudding: Mix the pudding according to package directions incorporating 1/2 cup malted milk powder. Refrigerator until ready to use.For the Chocolate Malt Cream: Whip 1 1/2 cups heavy cream with 1/4 cup malted milk powder, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 Tb. cocoa powder. Whip to a firm consistency then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.For the Whipped Cream: Whip the remaining heavy cream with 1/3 cup powdered sugar until light and fluffy. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.To assemble: Allow the brownies to cool completely before adding the layers. Neatly add a little less than 1/4 cup scoop of pudding (3 Tb.) to each jar. Followed by the same amount of chocolate malt cream. Top each jar with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of chocolate shavings. (Use a veggie peeler to shave the chocolate bar.)Place the seal over each jar followed by a paper cocktail napkins. Then twist the ring on--you may need to tap it down due to the napkin. Use ribbon or twine to attach a spoon.
