Try pairing with Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc. Chowder can benefit from a crisp white to cut through the rich, creamy broth - or you can go big or go home with a rich, buttery chardonnay.

Add potatoes, pepper, onion  and garlic and heat a minute or two until garlic is fragrant. Add chicken broth, Italian seasoning, salt, brown sugar, red pepper flakes and corn. Simmer 10 minutes or until potatoes are cooked and can be easily pierced with a sharp knife.Meanwhile, prepare your roux. In a large bowl (you want to leave room for the liquid to rise when it boils, because if you don't you'll have a big mess in the microwave) melt butter in the microwave. Add flour and stir. Add milk and whisk until smooth.Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Put back in the microwave and cook on high for 1.5 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Continue microwaving for 45 seconds-1 minute at a time, whisking each time, until mixture is thick. Watch your microwave closely to make sure it is not bubbling over. (*You can easily do this on the stove if you're worried about the mixture bubbling over). If the milk has thickened (think Alfredo sauce thick), add to the soup as soon as potatoes are cooked.
