A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

In a large bowl, beat butter, eggs, and sugar together with a hand mixer for about 3 minutes until light and fluffy. Mix in vanilla.In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer running on low, alternately add dry ingredients and buttermilk to butter mixture, beginning and finishing with dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Stir in coconut and pecans until fully incorporated.Pour batter into a bundt pan which has been buttered and floured to ensure easy removal. Spread batter evenly over pan. Bake for about 60-65 minutes, rotating halfway through if necessary, until a toothpick comes out with no more than a few moist crumbs on it.Five or so minutes before the cake is finished baking, make the glaze. In a small saucepan, combine water, butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Bring to a boil, before reducing the heat and cooking for about 5 minutes more. Timing does not have to be exact; if it is done before the cake comes out of the oven, pull it off the burner, and leave it until the cake is ready.As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, pour half the syrup over the cake. It will bubble and sizzle. As soon as the cake cools slightly and stops sizzling, invert the cake onto a serving plate, being very careful, as the cake is still hot. When the cake is inverted onto the plate, it should come out of the pan easily, pour most of the remainder of the syrup over the cake. Let cake sit for about 10 minutes, before cutting into pieces and serving with more syrup drizzled over each piece.The cake may be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag. Thaw in a 350 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
