Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C). Lightly spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray. Dust it lightly with spelt flour.2. Holding the cinnamon sticks with tongs, toast them an inch or so above a high gas flame for about 1 minute, or until they darken a shade and are fragrant. You can also set them directly on a hot electric coil and turn them as they toast. This takes 20 to 30 seconds. With either method, be sure to wear oven mitts or use a reliable pot holder.3. In a saucepan, mix together the apple juice, star anise, and cinnamon sticks over medium heat and simmer gently for about 10 minutes to infuse the apple juice with the spices. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Discard the cinnamon sticks and star anise.4. Add the sweet potato pulp and nutmeg to the pan and cook over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Add a little more apple juice if the pulp seems dry.5. In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt and whisk to ensure thorough mixing. Slowly stir in the sweet potato pulp mixture.6. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, yogurt, goat cheese, and egg. Add the oil and whisk again until smooth. Fold in the sweet potato mixture.7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.8. Let the bread cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes.
