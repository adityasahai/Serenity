Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

To prepare salad, combine water and 1/3 cup lemon juice in a Dutch oven. Cut off stem of each artichoke to within 1/2 inch of base; peel stem. Cut 1 inch off tops of artichokes. Remove bottom leaves and tough outer leaves, leaving tender heart and bottom. Cut artichokes lengthwise into quarters; place in lemon water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until tender. Drain and plunge into cold water. Drain well.
