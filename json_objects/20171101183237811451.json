Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color.
