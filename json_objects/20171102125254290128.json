The finer the chocolate is chopped, the easier it will melt and the quicker the truffle-making process will go.In a separate small mixing bowl, add coconut milk and microwave until very warm but not boiling - about 25 seconds (alternatively, heat in a small saucepan over medium heat until just starting to simmer).Immediately add coconut milk to chocolate and loosely cover with a cooking lid or towel to trap the heat in. Do not touch for 5 minutes, then lift cover and use a mixing spoon to gently stir, trying not to incorporate air. Continue stirring until completely melted, creamy and smooth.NOTE: If, for some reason, you have unmelted pieces left, you can microwave the mixture in 10-second increments until completely smooth (just be careful not to overcook or it can affect the integrity of the chocolate).Add vanilla at this time and stir (optional).Set the mixture in the refrigerator to chill uncovered for 2-3 hours, or until almost completely solid. A good test is dipping a knife into the middle of the bowl to see if any chocolate sticks. If it comes out mostly clean, its ready to scoop. If theres still wet chocolate in the center, continue refrigerating.Once chilled and firm, prepare a small dish of cocoa or cacao powder for rolling (optional).Use a Tablespoon-sized scoop (such as this one from Amazon) or a Tablespoon to scoop out small balls (see photo), then use your hands to gently but quickly roll/form the chocolate into balls.Toss in cocoa or cacao powder to coat and shake off excess (or leave bare), then set on a parchment-lined serving dish. Continue until all chocolate is scooped. There should be about 16 truffles, depending on the size of your scoop.If any of the chocolate near the center of the bowl was too soft to form, refrigerate that portion for a bit longer before proceeding.Enjoy truffles immediately, or refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight. This allows them to set and firm up.Store truffles covered in the refrigerator for best freshness. To serve, let come to room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving for optimum creaminess.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
