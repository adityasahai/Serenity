Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Gently pull the dough together and form it into a log.  If it is still crumbly, work it with your hands until it holds together smoothly. Roll it up in the paper, smoothing the shape as you go.

If a slice crumbles a bit, just smoosh the dough back together.  These don't have to be perfect disks.Bake on a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet at 325 for about 12-14 minutes.  The cookies will  not be browned, and they may look undone, but don't over bake.  One of the joys of shortbread cookies is that they fall apart and melt in your mouth.Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Set oven to 325FCream the butter and the peanut butter together in a stand mixer, with a hand mixer, or a wooden spoon.
