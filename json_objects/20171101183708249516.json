Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Silverado Mt. George Merlot. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 29 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436498,"title":"Silverado Mt.
