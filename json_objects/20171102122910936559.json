Toast all slices lightly.2) Stir minced chives into cream cheese and season with salt and pepper.3) Slice tomatoes and rinse and dry lettuce.4) For eggs, whisk each egg separately. In a small skillet or on a griddle heated over medium heat, add a drizzle of olive oil. Add eggs and cook for a minute or two until they are almost set.5) Flip egg carefully and try to gently shape the egg into roughly a shape that will fit on a bagel. Add a slice of provolone to each egg and let melt for a minute or so. Reduce heat to low so the eggs don't overcook.6) Build sandwiches by smearing some of the cream cheese on the bottom slice. Top with lettuce, tomato, and a few turkey slices. Add middle of bagel and smear on more cream cheese. Then top with cooked egg and cheese and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.Cover bagel with top and cut in half for easier eating!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add eggs and cook for a minute or two until they are almost set.5) Flip egg carefully and try to gently shape the egg into roughly a shape that will fit on a bagel.","ingredients":[{"id":18408,"name":"bagel","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bagels.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add a slice of provolone to each egg and let melt for a minute or so.
