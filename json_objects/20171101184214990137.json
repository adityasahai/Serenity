Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, combine Parmesan, thyme, lemon juice, lemon zest, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.Cook pasta according to directions. For two servings I boil only 1/3 of the package. Drain the cooked pasta and immediately place it in the bowl with the Parmesan mixture. Add olive oil and gently toss to combine. Taste and add additional salt and pepper if needed.In a skillet heat a small drizzel of olive oil over medium-low heat. Crack two eggs in the skillet. Cook until whites are almost firm, about 2 to 3 minutes. With a spatula, carefully flip the eggs over and turn off and remove the skillet from heat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.For each serving, plate the pasta and top it with an egg. Garnish with Parmesan shavings and a sprig of thyme, optional.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine Parmesan, thyme, lemon juice, lemon zest, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.Cook pasta according to directions.
