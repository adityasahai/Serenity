If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. You could try Bellissima Sparkling rosé. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Then use your dough hook to knead for two minutes, until the ball of dough is formed.Mix flours together and add the other ingredients to a well in the center. Begin by stirring in the center, mixing the eggs with the other ingredients to break them up, and slowly adding the flour. Knead until a smooth elastic dough is formed. Allow it to sit, covered, while you make the filling.Peel, dice and boil your potatoes until fork tender. Remove from heat.Blend together potato and the remaining filling ingredients.When ready to use, roll your dough out on a floured surface. Use a cookie cutter or cup to cut circles in the dough. Place a spoonful of filling in each circle. Fold one edge over the other to form a crescent shape. Pinch ends together with a fork to form a seal. Be sure that the edges are completely sealed; otherwise your filling will leak as your boiling the pierogies and it’ll get messy.Alternatively, you can use a pierogi press (like in the pictures), making it a hundred times easier.Put a pot of water on the stove with a pinch of salt. Drop your pierogies into the boiling water for a few minutes to cook them. They will float to the surface when they are ready.Scoop them out and allow them to sit in a colander to get the excess water off.I recommend browning them in melted butter to give them a crisp texture and a nice rich color.You can freeze them by lining them up on a cookie sheet and putting them in the freezer.
