Whisk to combineMicrowave the coconut butter, coconut oil, honey and molasses at 20 second intervals, stirring in between each one, until the coconut butter is melted.  Pour over dry ingredients and fold with a rubber spatula until all the flour is incorporatedSpray a deep dish pie pan with cooking spray, coat with some of the brown rice flour.  Use the rest of the brown rice flour to coat your tabletop/cutting boardForm a ball with the dough and place onto the floured surface. Roll to desired thickness (note:  I like thick crusts, and I still had some leftover... I ate some while cooking, I recommend doing so too), and press into your pie pan.  Refrigerate while you make the filling.Melt the chocolate at 30 second intervals, stirring in between each one, until chocolate is melted.  Set asideIn another large bowl, add the honey, vanilla paste, stevia, almond extract, salt and cream cheese.  Whip with a hand mixer or stand mixerAdd the protein powder, and whip againSlowly add the chocolate, whip again and make sure it's a homogeneous mixture.  Take crust out of fridge and pour in the filling.  Freeze while you make the topping (I refrigerated, but it would probably harden better in the freezer)Melt the white chocolate in a small bowl at 30 second intervals until melted (doesn't take as long as the 60% cacao chocolate)Put the yogurt, dried milk and stevia into a medium bowl, whip with a hand mixer or stand mixerAdd the white chocolate and whip again.  Take pie out of freezer (or fridge if you choose) and pour topping over pie.
