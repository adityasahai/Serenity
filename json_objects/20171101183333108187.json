Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue.

Once it has cooled, squeeze out the water very well.Mix to combine the sundried tomatoes, spinach, bread crumbs, chicken stock, and cheese. It's going to seem too wet at first, but the bread crumbs will soak up the chicken stock.

Pound the two sides flat with a frying pan or meat pounder.Spread the flattened pork with the stuffing mixture, then roll it up nice and tight. Season the entire exterior of the rolled pork with salt and pepper, then wrap the tenderloin with the pancetta slices. Truss the pork tenderloin with twine (here's a video to help you do it. This isn't quite how I do mine, but close. I'll do a video soon).Roast for about 30 minutes, until it reaches 145 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.Let the meat rest for at least 10 minutes so all the juices don't run out.
