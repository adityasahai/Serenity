Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. You could try Ghost Block Oakville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 60 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447663,"title":"Ghost Block Oakville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Finesse oriented with an elegant balance and structure, supported by bright aromas of roses, tobacco and spice. The attack is full on the palate with blackberries, cherries, cocoa, and cinnamon. The ripe mid palate ties together a long finish of cherries, caramel, spice, cassis and coffee.","price":"$59.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447663-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/ghost-block-oakville-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-2010/124053"}]},"instructions":"1) Preheat oven to 375. Spray shallow baking dish with pam.2) In a large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients together. Mix well, be sure not to leave any chunks of burger not mixed. I use clean hands for this. Officially use a wooden spoon.3) Place in baking pan and cover top with Ketchup.4) Place in oven and cook to 170 temp (about 1 hour)5) Remove from oven and using turkey baster remove collected fat and fluid.Notes: I’m told that you can make meatloaf tough by over mixing. I have never done this and I’m not sure it’s possible. A cheap ketchup would probably spoil this so I always use Hunt’s or Heinz.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375.
