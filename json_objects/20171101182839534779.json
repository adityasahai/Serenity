Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 8 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439141,"title":"Casa Catelli Pinot Grigio","description":"It has a straw yellow color. On the nose it has floral notes with hint of dry hay and fresh lemon. On the palate it has a soft citrus flavor with hints of crusty bread and acacia honey. Indeed, well balanced and pleasant to drink with and without food.","price":"$7.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439141-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/casa-catelli-pinot-grigio-2014/142131"}]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.In a large pot, combine the vegetable broth and water and bring to boil. Add in the cauliflower florets, cover and cook until fork tender, about 7-9 minutes.While the cauliflower cooks, heat the avocado oil up on medium-high heat. Add in the onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown.Scrape the cooked onion/garlic into a large blender, along with the almond milk.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cauliflower into the blender. Try to get as little of the cooking liquid into the blender with the cauliflower when you transfer it. Add in the salt and pepper and blend until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender as necessary.Place two layers of potatoes into the bottom of large casserole dish, slightly overlapping each layer (mine is a 10 inch square) and then spoon 1/3 of the sauce on top (just over 1 1/2 cups). Repeat with another two layers, followed by another 1/3 of sauce. Finally do 2 more final layers and cover with the remaining sauce. I like to push the potatoes away from the sides of the pan and make sure to spoon some down the sides as well, and then press the potatoes down evenly.Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Then uncover and bake until lightly browned and the potatoes are fork tender, about 30-40 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool.Sprinkle with parsley and DEVOUR.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.In a large pot, combine the vegetable broth and water and bring to boil.","ingredients":[{"id":6615,"name":"vegetable broth","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-broth.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add in the cauliflower florets, cover and cook until fork tender, about 7-9 minutes.While the cauliflower cooks, heat the avocado oil up on medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":10011135,"name":"cauliflower florets","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"},{"id":4581,"name":"avocado oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/avocado-oil.jpg"},{"id":11135,"name":"cauliflower","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cauliflower.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":9,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add in the onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown.Scrape the cooked onion/garlic into a large blender, along with the almond milk.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cauliflower into the blender.
