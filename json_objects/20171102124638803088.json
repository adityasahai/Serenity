Pour mixture over the bread and berries in the slow cooker. Gently press the bread down into the egg mixture. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes and then press the bread down again. Repeat until the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 30 minutes.Cook on low for 3 - 4 hours. The casserole will be slightly browned on the edges when done. If there appears to be any excess liquid, remove the lid and cook for an additional 30-60 minutes. Serve with powdered sugar or maple syrup.*Note: Don't skimp on the evaporated milk and heavy cream. If you sub regular milk, there is a chance that it could curdle or clump during cooking. I was able to sub almond milk for the heavy cream & evap milk and it turned out great.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place a Reynolds Slow Cooker Liner in crock of slow cooker and set aside.Slice bread into 1-inch thick slices.
