French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Mouton Cadet Bordeaux Rouge with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436703,"title":"Mouton Cadet Bordeaux Rouge","description":"Through its balance, roundness and aging capacity, the fruits of generous nature and the work of human hands, Mouton Cadet Rouge express all the richness and diversity of one of the world's foremost winegrowing regions.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436703-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/mouton-cadet-bordeaux-rouge-2011/122961"}]},"instructions":"Prep the butter. Unwrap the butter and cut it into large pieces, about 8 per stick. Leave on counter. If your kitchen is particularly cool, you may want to do this about 15 minutes ahead of time. (If your butter is frozen, thaw in the fridge overnight before using.)Make the syrup. Combine the sugar and water in the small saucepan and place on the stove over a medium flame.Beat the yolks. While the syrup is coming up to temperature, add the yolks and pinch of salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on high speed until pale and thick.Add the syrup. When the syrup reaches the softball stage (238F) remove from heat. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the syrup to the yolks to avoid splattering the syrup on the beaters. Stop pouring every 10 seconds or so and increase the speed to high, then switch it to low and drizzle in more syrup. Do this until all the syrup is incorporated.Beat until cool. After all the syrup has been incorporated, beat on high speed until the mixture has cooled to room temperature. This can take about 10 minutes.Add the butter. When the mixture and the bowl no longer feel warm, switch to the paddle attachment and start adding the butter one cube at a time, mixing well in-between each addition.Add vanilla. Add the vanilla (or other flavoring) and continue to beat until the buttercream is smooth and slightly stiff.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prep the butter.
