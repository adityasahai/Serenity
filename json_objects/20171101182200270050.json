Chianti are great choices for Lasagne. Lasagna pairs well with medium-bodied red wine with higher acidity. Sangiovese, Montepulciano, and Chianti all fit the bill. One wine you could try is Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":447010,"title":"Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo","description":"At 1,000 feet above sea level, Valle Reale's vineyards are nestled into one of Italy's most beautifulnational parks. This rich 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is made from the oldest estate vineyards,planted back in 1975 on soils rich in chalk, clay and pebbles. Harvested by hand in the second partof October, the grapes are gently pressed and macerated with the skins for 1012days to ensureideal color concentration and structure. After full malolactic fermentation in barrels, the wine ismatured for one more year in the same French barriques and then refined in bottle for another eightmonths.Valle Reale introduces the wine lover to a new breed of Montepulciano. Surprisingly concentrated,with silky tannins and layers of dark berry fruit and spices, this is a rich and aromatic Montepulcianod'Abruzzo. Fullbodiedand firm, yet supple, it is ready to be enjoyed with hearty pasta dishes,roasted poultry or lamb, and ribs.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447010-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/valle-reale-vigneto-di-popoli-montepulciano-dabruzzo-2006/104761"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Melt the butter in a large saute pan on medium heat. Add the zucchini and yellow squash and cook until slightly tender, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the spinach and turn off the heat. Toss to combine, letting the spinach wilt. Season with salt and pepper.                          Spray a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place 3 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the baking dish, forming 1 layer (the noodles may overlap). Layer one-third of the veggie mixture, one-third of the ricotta cheese and one-third of the Cherry Tomato Sauce in the dish, spreading each layer evenly. Top with 1/2 cup of the basil. Repeat a second time with the noodles, veggie mixture, ricotta and tomato sauce; top with the remaining 1/2 cup basil. Repeat a third time, but finish the top layer with the mozzarella.                          Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil, turn the oven to broil and broil on high until the cheese is crisp and golden, about 5 minutes.                          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Combine the tomatoes, oregano, thyme, parsley, olive oil, garlic and onions on a large baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and toss, making sure everything is evenly coated. Bake until the tomatoes are golden and the onions are caramelized, about 20 minutes.                          Carefully peel the garlic, making sure not to burn your fingers. Transfer the ingredients to a blender and process until smooth. Check for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if desired. Reserve for later use.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Melt the butter in a large saute pan on medium heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the zucchini and yellow squash and cook until slightly tender, about 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11641,"name":"yellow squash","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yellow-squash.jpg"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Add the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Add the spinach and turn off the heat.
