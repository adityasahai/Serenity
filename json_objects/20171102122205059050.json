Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Carpineta Fontalpino Chianti Classico. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":446740,"title":"Carpineta Fontalpino Chianti Classico","description":"The color is typical of the purity of the Sangiovese, a deep red with traces of violet.
