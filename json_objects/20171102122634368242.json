Spoon batter into a large ziplock baggie, and cut off a 1/2 inch tip from one corner. Pipe the batter into the pan, filling the holes about 3/4 full. If you only have one pan, do this in batches, but be sure to clean out the pan thoroughly before reusing. Bake for about 15 minutes until risen and cooked through, you can use a toothpick to check. They will still be pale, so don't judge by the color.Let the doughnuts cool for a couple of minutes before removing them to a cooling rack.Make the glaze by slowly adding maple syrup to the sugar to achieve a thick glaze texture.  You can always adjust the glaze by adding more sugar or more syrup.  Add the extract and stir well.While the doughnuts are still slightly warm, dip them into the glace, headfirst, and give them a little twist as you raise them up out of the bowl.  Set them, glaze side up, on the rack to dry.Eat the doughnuts asap, they are best when freshly made.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Set oven to 350FMelt the butter in a large microwave safe mixing bowl.
