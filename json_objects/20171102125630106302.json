Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The Champagne Marc Hebrart Cuvee de Reserve Brut Premier Cru with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 48 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":464318,"title":"Champagne Marc Hebrart Cuvee de Reserve Brut Premier Cru","description":"The signature are there, and there's a stealthy richness on the mid-palate; with five minutes in the glass it really exhales.

Stir until onions and pepper are soft but not browned. Add diced ham and stir until the ham is limp and heated through. Immediately remove from heat and set aside.In a mixing bowl add eggs, water and salt beat and stir well. Set aside.Heat a 12\" fry pan on medium low heat, add a little oil (1 teaspoon.) or spray with a non stick vegetable spray. A non stick pan works great. Place egg mixture in pan and sprinkle with onions, bell pepper, ham, tomato if you wish, sausage, bacon, and 1/2 of the roast beef, and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese. Place a lid on until omelet starts to set. Immediately remove lid and fold omelet from the sides to the middle. If this is difficult fold in half. sprinkle with the rest of cheese and roast beef.Serve with a side order of Picante Sauce or Sour Cream with a little diced green onion.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a sauce pan on medium low heat melt butter and add onions and bell peppers.
