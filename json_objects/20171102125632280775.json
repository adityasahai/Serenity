Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cut the squash and zucchini into thin quarter rounds. Thinly slice the red onion. Peel and then grate the carrots using a box grater or large holed cheese grater. Roughly chop the fresh parsley. Place all of these vegetables in a large bowl. You can also add the broccoli if you want it raw, or proceed with the steps below for blanched (lightly cooked) broccoli.Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and let it continue to boil for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente. While the water is boiling, cut the broccoli crown into small pieces. Add the broccoli pieces to the boiling water with the pasta for the last 60 seconds of cooking. Drain the pasta and broccoli in a colander and rinse briefly with cool water to stop the broccoli from cooking and cool off the pasta. Let them drain really well.While the pasta is cooking, make the creamy dressing by whisking together the buttermilk, mayonnaise, garlic powder, salt, freshly cracked pepper, and lemon juice.Once the pasta has cooled and is very well drained, add it to the bowl with the vegetables. Pour the dressing over top and stir to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the squash and zucchini into thin quarter rounds. Thinly slice the red onion.
