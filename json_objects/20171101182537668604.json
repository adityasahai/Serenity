are great choices for Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. You could try Madsen Family Cellars Sangiovese Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431618,"title":"Madsen Family Cellars Sangiovese Wine","description":"This wine has a pronounced nose with a hint of coffee while your mouth is invaded with spices; clove, licorice, and cinnamon.The palate features cherries and notes of clove which continue on to a smooth, long finish with subtle oak, slight pepper and berry flavors. The tartness of the wine works well with food as Sangiovese is a food wine, but can be enjoyed on its own as well.

Note - a large cauliflower will make a LARGE crust! Go smaller and use only 1 egg if you want to serve fewer people.Put the cauliflower florets in afood processor and pulse until crumbs remain - you want it to almost look like snow. Place all of the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and cover it with a paper towel. Microwave for 5 minutes. Remove the cauliflower and spread it on a towel to cool.Once cool, wrap the cauliflower in a towel and squeeze every last bit of water and liquid out of it over your sink. When you think you're finished, squeeze again! You want all of the moisture out. Place the cauliflower in a large (dry) bowl. Stir in the cheeses, seasonings and spices and eggs, mixing until combined. You want to end with a ball of cauliflower dough, so you might need to use your hands to pull it together.Place the dough ball on a piece of parchment paper (no larger than your pizza stone) and press the dough into a circle, making sure the crust is thin. I like to go about 1/4 inch in thickness. Gently pick up the parchment paper and place the entire crust (parch and all) on your pizza stone. Bake for 10 t0 12 minutes, or until golden. They key here is make the crust crisp and sturdy enough so it doesn't crumble or break apart.Once the crust is golden, (gently) remove it and cover it in your desired toppings. I do sauce first, then cheese and everything listed about, along with more cheese on top. Make the pizza however you'd like! Very carefully transfer the pizza (again, still on parchment) back to the pizza stone. Have someone else help you or use a pizza peel. Bake the pizza for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Cover with extra parmesan. Serve immediately!Note: large slices are difficult to *pick up* - you may need a knife and fork.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and place a pizza stone inside.
