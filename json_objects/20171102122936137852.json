Put in a shallow dish, covered, and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour. Pat the pieces dry with a paper towel.Pour the oil into a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, and when it shimmers, brown the beef and marrow bone in batches, if necessary, taking care not to crowd the pan and adding oil by teaspoonfuls if the pan becomes too dry.With a slotted spoon, transfer the browned beef and bone to a bowl and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, paprika and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Cook, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan and adding a teaspoon of water or oil if the pan becomes dry, until the onion softens, about 6 minutes; you don’t want the onion itself to char.Add 1 quart of water and the tomatoes, return the beef and marrow bone to the pan and cover. When the soup simmers gently, uncover and reduce the heat to low. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is just tender, about 1 hour. Add the okra and continue cooking until the okra is just tender, about 25 minutes.Discard the bay leaves and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Divide among bowls, garnish with parsley, if desired, and serve.Try out these Southern soup recipes on Food Republic:Classic Turtle Soup RecipeNorman Van Aken's Souse RecipeMama's Seafood Gumbo Recipe","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Season the beef and marrow bone with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
