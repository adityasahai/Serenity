Sparkling rosé are my top picks for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 56 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445451,"title":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"Shows dark plum/garnet with some amber and orange at the edge. The nose shows roasted herbs and meatiness with some background notes of sweet cherry, truffle and vegetal qualities. This is a distinctive Pinot Noir with aromatics that are very old-world. In the mouth the wine has always had a certain austerity but a bit of a gap in the middle. The wine has held up nicely over time but has never really developed the sweetness and charm that we would expect of our best Pinot Noirs.","price":"$55.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445451-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/beaux-freres-the-beaux-freres-vineyard-pinot-noir-1996/126352"}]},"instructions":"Heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy soup pot over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, Add minced garlic and cumin, cook for another minute. Add the beer. Remove the mixture to a blender and process until you have a smooth puree. Set aside.While the onions are cooking, peel the potatoes and cut into 1 inch cubes. After the onion mixture has been transferred to the blender, add the potatoes to the soup pot with another tablespoon of butter. Saute until potatoes are fragrant and turning golden.Add onion mixture back to the pot with the potatoes, along with one cup of stock and 1 cup water. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Mash the potatoes thoroughly with a potato masher. While the potatoes are cooking, char the chile pepper in a skillet, over a gas flame or in the broiler until the skin is blackened. Put in a baggie or paper bag to steam for about 5 minutes. Then remove the skin and seeds. Resist the temptation to rinse the chile - water will dilute the wonderful smoky flavor of the chile. Chop the chile. Add to the blender with 1/4 cup of half & half and puree.Whisk a cup of the warm soup into the half & half, then add to the pot with the grated cheese and  whisk until blended. Add more broth or water if mixture is thicker than you prefer. Serve hot and garnish with cilantro and/or avocado and Queso Fresco crumbles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy soup pot over medium high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally,","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-onion.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add minced garlic and cumin, cook for another minute.","ingredients":[{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the beer.","ingredients":[{"id":14006,"name":"beer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beer.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Remove the mixture to a blender and process until you have a smooth puree.
