Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

To candy the pumpkin seeds, preheat the oven to 350. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.2. In a small bowl, combine the corn syrup, sugar, and salt, stirring to combine. Mix in the pumpkin seeds and stir until coated. Spread the pumpkin seeds out on the parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes and then break apart into smaller pieces. Set aside.3. For the crust, pulse the flour. cornmeal, sugar and salt together in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Mix in the egg and egg yolk, pulsing until mixture starts to come together. If mixture seems dry, add water, 1 tsp at a time, until it comes together. Pat into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.4. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 13-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch springform pan and gently press it into the bottoms and onto the sides. Tear off any high areas of the dough so that it is no less than 1/2-inch below the top of the pan. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.5. Heat the oven to 350. Line the crust with aluminum foil and fill it with dried beans, pressing them against the sides. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and beans and bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes.6. For the caramel, in a 2-quart saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, and salt over medium heat. Stir until the sugar melts and begins to darken around the edges, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the cream and simmer, whisking occasionally, until smooth and thick enough that moving the whisk through the caramel leaves a line so that you can see the bottom of the pan, 7-9 minutes. Whisk in the bourbon and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thick enough that the whisk leaves a trail through it, 2 minutes. Transfer to a measuring cup. Pour 1/3 cup of the caramel over the bottom of the crust and spread it out evenly.7. For the filling, in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and the egg yolk, one at a time, beating until well-combined. Add the pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt, mixing until combined. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the half and half.8. Pour the filling into the crust and bake until it has puffed slightly and no longer appears to be wet, 35-40 minutes. Cool on a rack for 1 hour.9. Drizzle the remaining caramel over the tart and spread it evenly. Arrange the pumpkin seeds around the edges of the tart. Cover tart with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve chilled.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To candy the pumpkin seeds, preheat the oven to 350. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.2.
