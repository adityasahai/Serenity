If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork, then place directly on the center rack in the oven. Bake until tender, about 1 hour.                          Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 or 4 turns pepper; saute until the leeks are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and thyme and saute until lightly browned, another 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.                          Halve the baked potatoes lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Set aside to cool. Reserve the potato innards for another use.                          Fill a deep, heavy pot with 3 inches of canola oil; heat to 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.                          Working in batches, fry the potato skins in the oil until crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.                          Arrange the fried potato skins, scooped-side up, on a baking sheet. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 3 or 4 turns pepper. Fill the skins with the mushroom-leek filling and top with the Brie and prosciutto. Transfer to the oven and bake until the brie is melted and the prosciutto crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Garnish with the chives and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork, then place directly on the center rack in the oven.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Bake until tender, about 1 hour.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the leeks, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 or 4 turns pepper; saute until the leeks are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11246,"name":"leek","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/leeks.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Add the mushrooms and thyme and saute until lightly browned, another 5 to 6 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Remove from the heat and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":9,"step":"Halve the baked potatoes lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell.
