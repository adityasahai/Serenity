Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. One wine you could try is Trinchero Mario's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 48 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":449860,"title":"Trinchero Mario's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Presents baked blackberry pie and vanilla on the nose, followed by cassis, caramel and integrated oak flavors.

Line a 13-x9-inch pan with foil and spray with nonstick spray.Prepare the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan, whisk together over low heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, then set aside to cool.Assemble the meatloaf: Place the ground beef in a large bowl. Tear the sausage into chunks and add it to the bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the sauce. Set aside.Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, add the onion and carrot and saute for 5 to 8 minutes... just until the vegetables are softened. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Let cool.In a medium bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, milk and egg. Add this mixture to the beef/sausage and use clean hands to gently combine. Add the sauteed vegetables, thyme and a good dose of salt and pepper and work those gently into the meat mixture. You don't want to overwork the meat or you run the risk of turning out a tough meatloaf.Lightly pat the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf in the prepared pan. Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the sauce on top. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes, or until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F. on an instant read thermometer. Spoon additional glaze over the meatloaf in the last 25 minutes of baking, and save the rest for serving with individual slices. Let the meatloaf stand for about 10 minutes before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan, whisk together over low heat.
