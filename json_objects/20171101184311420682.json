Try pairing with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 58 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435309,"title":"Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot","description":"This wine shows aromas of sweet plum sauce, vanilla, chocolate, cedar and butterscotch with big, forward black cherry and black berry fruit in the mouth. A balanced middle with a hint of toasty oak is paired with a nice bite from rounded tannins, and a long pleasant finish. This wine pairs well with grilled meats and wild game with herb-infused, wild-berry sauces, hearty pasta dishes and Pacific Northwest Salmon.","price":"$57.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435309-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/duckhorn-napa-valley-merlot-1995/26649"}]},"instructions":"To make the dressing/marinade, combine all ingredients in a mason jar with the lid. Shake vigorously to combine; taste and adjust seasonings to taste. Place steak in a plastic zipper bag. Pour in half the marinade and seal. Refrigerate and marinate for at least two hours. Prepare the onion strings: Slice onion very thin. Place in a baking dish and cover with buttermilk and soak for at least an hour. Make the candied pecans: Spread pecans on a baking mat or sheet of waxed paper. Add sugar and water to a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Cook to 280 degrees, or until dark and clear amber in color, about 5 to 6 minutes. Pour mixture over pecans (may not need all of mixture) and quickly stir/poke with a fork to evenly distribute mixture all over pecans. Allow to cool completely. Make the onion strings: Combine dry ingredients and set aside. Heat oil to 375 degrees. Grab a handful of onions, throw into the flour mixture, tap to shake off excess, and PLUNGE into hot oil. Fry for a few minutes and remove to a paper towel-lined plate as soon as they are golden brown. Repeat until onions are gone.Grill (or sautee) the steak over medium-high heat until medium rare, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and allow to rest. Slice steak against the grain in thin slices. In a large bowl, add lettuce mix, blue cheese, and cherry tomatoes. Add a little dressing and toss to combine. Add more if needed. Add candied pecans at the end and toss to combine.Heap salad on a plate, making sure to get plenty of blue cheese, tomatoes, and pecans on each plate. Add half a steak to the top of each plate, then top the steak with onion strings. Serve immediately.
