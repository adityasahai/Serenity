Gently place eggs in a pot and ensure all eggs are completely covered with water (make sure the pot is not too big - only large enough so that all eggs  cover the bottom surface of the pot with very little space in between each egg). Set a timer on for exactly 20 minutes and immediately place pot on a burner at max. As soon as the water starts to boil,  lower heat to med. After exactly 20 minutes, briefly run under cold water to stop the cooking process. To achieve that perfect yellow yolk without even the slightest hint of grey ferrous sulfide, it is imperative to not pass the 20 minute mark from the time you place the pot on the burner to the time you remove it.Peel eggs immediately (do not wait). If they're still too hot to peel, run cold water and peel, but do not wait for eggs to cool inside the pot.  Cut eggs in half and place the yolks in another bowl. Add mayonnaise (see recipe below), salt and pepper to yolk, mash together with a fork and scoop back into cooked egg white halves. Sprinkle with paprika.Melt coconut oil and allow to cool. Once cooled combine it with the olive oil. In a bowl mix together all other ingredients except the oil mixture. Use your mixer with a whisk attachment and SLOWLY pour in the oil while mixer is going. Start with 1 drop at a time and then increase to a slow steady stream. This should take you at least 5 minutes to accomplish. Once all the oil is infused, you will have your mayonnaise.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"One of the best ways to boil eggs is to  put the eggs in a pot, fill with cold water and gradually let it boil.
