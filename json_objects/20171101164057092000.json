The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. You could try Mulderbosch Chenin Blanc. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":434512,"title":"Mulderbosch Chenin Blanc","description":"Pale yellow in color, with a hint of green. A clean, lively wine with abundant lemon and lime aromas on the nose, with nuances of nutmeg and cloves. Well-balanced and elegant, but with some weight and a powerful follow-through. Stylistically dry and lightly oaked, this is an excellent wine to enjoy with food.","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/434512-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/mulderbosch-chenin-blanc-2004/85657"}]},"instructions":"Stir together tamari, sesame oil, minced garlic, agave (or honey), sugar, mirin, and pepper. Mix well until the sugar is well dissolved.Place thinly-sliced beef into a large mixing bowl or a large Ziploc bag for easy cleanup. Add prepared marinade from step 1, to the beef. Mix well. You can use your hands to massage the meat to ensure that the marinade is absorbed by the meat.Cover tightly. Marinate 30 minutes – 1 hour in the refrigerator.Heat a grill pan or a skillet on medium-high heat. Add canola oil to coat the pan/skillet. Remove the beef from the marinade and grill until nicely browned. Don’t overcrowd the pan/skillet. Overcrowding will result in lowering of the temperature of the cooking surface; this will result in boiling or steaming of the meat. On moderately high heat, the meat should brown very quickly – within minutes.Garnish with chopped scallions and/or toasted sesame seeds if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Stir together tamari, sesame oil, minced garlic, agave (or honey), sugar, mirin, and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sesame-oil.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":10116124,"name":"tamari","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":19912,"name":"agave","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/maple-syrup-or-agave-nectar.jpg"},{"id":93830,"name":"mirin","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mirin.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix well until the sugar is well dissolved.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place thinly-sliced beef into a large mixing bowl or a large Ziploc bag for easy cleanup.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add prepared marinade from step 1, to the beef.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Mix well.
