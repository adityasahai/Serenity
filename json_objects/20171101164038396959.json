A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.
