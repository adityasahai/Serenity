Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":448945,"title":"Maso Canali Pinot Grigio","description":"The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio displays a brilliant pale golden color indicative of its crisp, citrus aromas and floral notes.

Put the chopped candlenuts and sesame seeds in a cast iron pan over medium high heat and toast them until they turn a medium brown color. You'll want to stir them constantly to make sure they brown evenly. When the nuts are brown, add the Alaea salt and stir to combine. Transfer the nuts onto a sheet of foil in a thin layer to let them cool.Slice the onions thinly and then soak them for at least 1 hour in a medium bowl of cold water with a teaspoon of baking soda. The baking soda neutralizes the volatile sulfur compounds that make raw onions so pungent, leaving you with crisp sweet onions without the tear inducing sting. When you're ready to use them, drain and rinse them well, and spin them in a salad spinner to remove the extra water. To make the Tuna Poke, whisk the sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar and hot sauce together. Add the tuna, seaweed, and onions and stir to combine. Top the Poke with the chopped scallions, and inamona.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the inamona, chop the candlenuts into small pebble sized pieces.","ingredients":[{"id":98958,"name":"candlenuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/candlenut.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the chopped candlenuts and sesame seeds in a cast iron pan over medium high heat and toast them until they turn a medium brown color.
