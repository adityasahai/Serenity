Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436659,"title":"Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"The aromas of this complex red wine range from cherries and plums to gladiolus flowers and earthy flint. The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish. Recommended for barbecued meat, like sliced Chianina steak, or with game, such as pheasant stuffed with truffles. It is also excellent with mature cheese.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436659-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/santa-margherita-chianti-classico-riserva-2013/167314"}]},"instructions":"Pour Swanson Natural Goodness Chicken Broth and water in a saucepan set over low heat and gently heat. Keep warm over a low flame while preparing the risotto.Place a large straight sided skillet over medium heat. Add uncooked barley and toast until golden brown and fragrant, stirring occasionally, 2-3 minutes. Take care not to let barley burn. Remove barley from pan and return pan to medium heat. Add olive oil and butter. After butter has melted add shallots and saut for 60 seconds until they begin to soften. Add garlic and saut an additional 60 seconds. Add barley back to pan and stir into shallot mixture.Once barley is stirred in, add wine to the pan. Stirring occasionally, let barley cook, keeping it at a low simmer, for about 4-5 minutes or until the wine is almost absorbed. Add about 1 cup of the warm stock to the barley pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes or until the stock has been almost absorbed. Repeat this process of adding stock, stirring, and simmering until barley is cooked through and has taken on a creamy, tender texture. The entire process will take about 60-65 minutes.Stir in spinach and allow to wilt. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour Swanson Natural Goodness Chicken Broth and water in a saucepan set over low heat and gently heat.
