A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the thawed puff pastry until you have roughly a 10in x 15in rectangle. Transfer the puff pastry to the prepared baking sheet. If your rectangle gets misshappen, just trim any wonky bits with a sharp knife.Using the tip of a sharp knife, score about 1 inch in from the edge of the pastry, without cutting all the way through. This will form a bit of a crust for the tart shell. On the inside of the scoring mark, make little prick marks with a fork in the pastry, spacing your marks about 1/4 inch a part. Be sure to prick all over the inside of the tart. This will prevent the pastry from puffing too much in the center.Bake the tart shell for about 12-15 minutes. Remove pastry from oven and reduce the oven temp to 325째F.Scatter the crumbled goat cheese all over the inside of the tart shell. Lay asparagus across the width of the tart,alternating tips and cut ends. Arrange sliced onion over the top of the asparagus and press down gently on the veggies to help them stay in place. Drizzle the entire tart with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Bake the assembled tart for 22-25 minutes or until asparagus is tender and goat cheese is soft.In the meantime, whisk together balsamic vinegar and honey in a small dish. Drizzle the balsamic and honey mixture over the tart after it comes out of the oven.Cut the tart into 8 pieces and serve!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400째F.
