Set aside. Melt the butter in a large glass or heatproof bowl. Add the sugar and vanilla, whisk until smooth. Add the flour and salt and and stir until just incorporated. Transfer the dough to the pan and use your fingers to press it into the bottom and to the edges evenly. Bake for about 18 minutes or until puffed slightly and golden. Keep the oven on.While the crust is baking prep the filling. Brown the butter by melting it in a saucepan over medium high heat until it is toasty brown (it happens quickly, so watch it carefully- for me it took about 5-6 mins.) Pour the brown butter into a glass measuring cup to cool slightly while preparing the rest of the filling.Whisk sugar, eggs, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Gradually whisk the browned butter into sugar-egg mixture smooth with no streaks or clumps.Arrange the raspberries in rows on the bottom of the cooled crust.Carefully pour the batter over the fruit. Bake bars until filling is puffed and golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30-40 minutes (the large range allows for different ovens. Mine only needed about 33 minutes, but the original recipe states 40. Watch carefully!)Use the parchment paper tabs to carefully remove cooled bars from pan and place them on a cutting board and cut them into squares with a very sharp knife.Serve room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375F.Line an 8x8 baking pan with two strips of parchment, overlapped like an X so the flaps hang over the pan for easy lifting.
