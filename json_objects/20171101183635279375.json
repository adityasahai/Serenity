Generously spray a muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the butter and both kinds of sugar.  Beat on medium speed until well combined.  Add in the egg, egg yolk and vanilla.  Beat until combined.  Add in the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the chocolate chips.Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the dough into each muffin tin.  Gently press the dough into the tin, so it covers the bottom and goes up the sides a little.  Bake for about 12 to 14 minutes, until golden brown.  Once you remove the pans from the oven, take a small spoon and gently press down a little in the center of each cup (if needed), so the frosting will have a place to sit.  The centers will still likely be a little gooey.  Take a butter knife and gently run it around the edge of each cup (so they pop out easily later).  Transfer the pans to a wire rack and allow to cool completely before removing the cookie cups.    To make the frosting - add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until light and fluffy. With the mixer on low, slowly add in the confectioners’ sugar and cocoa powder. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until well combined. Add in the salt, vanilla and milk. Beat on low speed until incorporated and then increase the speed to high and beat for about 3 minutes, until fluffy. To assemble - transfer the frosting to a plastic bag.  Seal the bag and then snip off a little bit on one corner.  Pipe the frosting in a little circle in the well in each cookie cup (you could also use a pastry bag with a tip here - I just didn’t want to dirty mine).  Use a small spoon to smooth out the top as needed so the frosting is level.  Sprinkle some of the chocolate shavings around the outer edge of each circle of frosting.  Use your fingers to press them down just a little.  Place three of the mini eggs in the center and press down gently on those as well.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the cookie cups - preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
