Try pairing with Lambrusco Dolce, Late Harvest Riesling, and Vin Santo. These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it. The Snake River Late Harvest Riesling with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431450,"title":"Snake River Late Harvest Riesling","description":"Made from the grapes left to hang on the vine in our estate Arena Valley Vineyard, Late Harvest Riesling is our original dessert wine.

Set aside.On a lightly floured surface, roll out pie dough until almost doubled in size. Using a 4 inch plate as a guide, cut 4 circles out of the dough. Place 1 circle of dough into one 4 oz mason jar (I used 4 oz Ball canning jars). Use fingers to press dough into the sides of the jar. Dough should hang over the lip of the jar by about 1/3 inch. If it doesn't, cut small strips of dough from the scrap and pinch it to the dough lining to create a small overhang around the mouth of the jar. Repeat with the remaining 3 pies. Cut extra dough strips into 1/3 inch strips for the lattice pieces.Divide apple filling amongst the 4 pie jars. The mixture will be heaping a bit. Place the reserved strips of dough over the filling (creating a lattice if desired) and crimp up the edges of the dough, sealing together ends of lattice pieces and the overhang of the bottom crust. Place pie jars onto a rimmed baking sheet.In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 teaspoon of water. Brush tops of pie crust with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar. Bake pies for 35 minutes or until crust is golden and filling is bubbly.Allow to cool before serving.Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place 1 circle of dough into one 4 oz mason jar (I used 4 oz Ball canning jars).
