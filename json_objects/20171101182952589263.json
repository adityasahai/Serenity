A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

If you are worried that your springform pan may not be completely watertight, place a layer of aluminum foil on the outside of the pan bottom and up the sides. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar and shredded coconut. Stir to combine. Add the melted butter, and mix together until well blended. Pour the graham cracker mixture into the springform pan, and using your hands, press firmly into the pan and up the sides. The crust does not come all the way up the sides, only about halfway. Bake crust at 350 degrees for 12 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Lower the oven temp to 325. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth, scraping sides and bottom of bowl often.  Add the sugar, cornstarch, vanilla bean paste (or extract, if using) and salt. Beat until smooth and combined. Slowly add the beaten eggs to the bowl, adding about a tablespoon or so at a time and mixing well between each addition. Add the coconut milk and coconut extract, if using, and beat until combined. Place the springform pan with the cooled coconut crust into a large roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake filling into the springform pan. Place the roasting pan on the center rack of the oven, and add hot water to the roasting pan until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake the cheesecake for 65-75 minutes, or until the filling is set and only slightly jiggly in the center. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven, being careful not to slosh the hot water, and then remove the springform pan. Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate 8 hours before removing from the springform pan. Sprinkle toasted coconut all over the top prior to serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350.
