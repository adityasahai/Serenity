Try pairing with Riesling, Sparkling Wine, and Zinfandel. In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. One wine you could try is Pacific Rim Riesling. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":446903,"title":"Pacific Rim Riesling","description":"Portraying bright crispness, subtle sweetness and aromas of jasmine, pear and apple, Pacific Rim Riesling exemplifies the harmony of Riesling.
