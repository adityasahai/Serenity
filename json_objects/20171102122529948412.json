A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Whisk maple syrup, 1 egg, and arrowroot in a small bowl. Using a ladle, spoon about 1/4 cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until smooth. Slowly pour mixture into the saucepan with the hot milk, whisking constantly. Whisk until mixture begins to boil and thickens, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla. Transfer pudding to a small bowl, cover and chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 3 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and adjust rack to middle position. Using a pastry brush, butter a 9-inch round tart pan. Place almond meal, coconut flour, sugar, gelatin and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 2-3 times to combine. Add butter and process until a dough forms. Press dough into and up the sides of the buttered tart pan. Bake for 12 minutes.Place almonds and whole cane sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until almonds are ground (do not grind to a paste). Beat butter and maple syrup using an electric mixer until combined (it will be a bit lumpy). With mixer on low, add 2 eggs, one at a time, until combined. Gradually beat in the almonds and then 1/2 cup of the pastry cream (you will have some pastry cream left over). Cover and chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 1 hour.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread filling over cooled crust and arrange figs, cut side up in concentric circles over filling. Place tart on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until filling is golden brown and set, about 35-45 minutes. Let tart cool completely in pan on a wire rack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour milk and cream into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk maple syrup, 1 egg, and arrowroot in a small bowl.
