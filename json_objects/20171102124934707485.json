Add that to a medium mixing bowl along with ground beef, parsley and green onions and knead well with your hands until uniformly blended. Form the meat mixture into 12 medium sized meatballs (no need to get them super nice and round at this stage)Using your thumb, make a dimple in each meatball and place a piece of avocado in that dimple. Delicately work the meat around that piece of avocado to completely encase it and form your meatball into a perfect sphere. Heat some coconut oil, ghee or lard in a large skillet over medium high heat. When pan is nice and hot, add the meatballs and cook, turning frequently, until crispy and golden brown all around, about 5-6 minutes total.
