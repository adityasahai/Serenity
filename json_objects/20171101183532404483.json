for Chicken Caesar Salad. We recommend a crisp, dry white wine such as a Gavi, Albariño, or Pinot Grigio. These wines stand up to the pungent dressing and complement the other flavors. You could try Salneval Albarino. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 9 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":446012,"title":"Salneval Albarino","description":"Light straw in color, the nose of this Albariño is seductive with honey, pear and tropical fruit and a slight mineral component. It is racy andzesty with citrus and floral flavors in the mouth, yet is round and soft at the same time.It matches perfectly with fresh seafood and shellfish; is an ideal accompaniment to salty, spicy Asian cuisine; and is also great on its own as a cocktail wine. Truly adventurous food lovers will amaze and inspire their friends by serving it with the unlikely, but fantastic pairing of traditional barbequed ribs with a sweet, slightly spicy tomato based sauce.","price":"$9.39","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446012-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/salneval-albarino-2008/98474"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Combine chicken and 2 tablespoons pina colada mix.
