Add 1/3 of goat to pan and brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining goat in two more batches, adding additional oil as necessary and controlling heat to prevent burning.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Return pan to heat and add onions and garlic.
