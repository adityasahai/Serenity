The yeast will dissolve and start to foam. Set aside until needed.In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attatchment or in a large bowl using a spoon, stir to combine milk, egg, olive oil, sugar and salt. Slowly pour the yeast mixture in and stir.Add the flour and Rosemary, stir until the mixture is combined. If using a stand mixer, switch to the kneading hook attachment and knead for 5 to 8 minutes on low until the dough has formed. It should still be tacky but smooth, add a touch more flour if too sticky. If you are not using a stand mixer, pour the dough onto a floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5 to 8 minutes until the dough is smooth.Place the dough onto a surface, I used a cutting board. At this time line your slow cooker with parchment paper. I used 2 strips going both directions (see picture up above). Lightly spray the parchment paper with cooking spray or a sprinkling of cornmeal to prevent sticking. With a knife, slice the dough into 12 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball with your hands and place in the slow-cooker on top of the parchment paper. If using a 6-quart slow-cooker, use all 12 rolls. If using a 4-quart slow-cooker, use 6 rolls and freeze the remaining for another use. The dough balls will touch, therefore when cooked they will be pull-apart rolls.  If you do not want them to touch, use less dough & leave a 1\" space in between rolls.Cover and cook on low for 1 hour to let the rolls rise. Then switch the heat to high and cook for 1 more hour. If using a 4-quart slow-cooker, check the rolls at 50 minutes. Remove the rolls by using the parchment paper to lift the rolls out of the slow-cooker. The rolls should be fluffy and cooked through. If you would like the rolls to be golden on top, remove them from the parchment paper onto a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes until golden. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, stir to combine warm water and yeast. The yeast will dissolve and start to foam.
