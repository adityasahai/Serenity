Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Finca La Malena Malbec with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431374,"title":"Finca La Malena Malbec","description":"100% Malbec from eastern Mendoza. Limestone and clay soils, cool winters and warm summers provide great fruit concentration, and smooth tannins. Dark ruby in color reflecting light in an array of orange/purple hues. Pleasant nose filled with hints of red forest fruits and herbs. Young round tannins give it a silky sensuous texture that leads to a rich mouthfeel. Mouthwatering layers of red berries, plum, vanilla and spice open as it warms up, delivering a rich varietal character. A delicate finish that bridges the gap between drinks and lingers well after the last sip.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431374-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Finca-Malena-Malbec-750mL/dp/B01N9QTXGO"}]},"instructions":"Form the beef into 4 patties and season with salt and pepper.Heat the grill to medium-high heat, brush with oil and grill the burgers until cooked, about 3-5 minutes per side and set aside.Lightly grill the buns, assemble the burgers and enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Form the beef into 4 patties and season with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":23572,"name":"beef","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/beef-cubes-raw.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the grill to medium-high heat, brush with oil and grill the burgers until cooked, about 3-5 minutes per side and set aside.Lightly grill the buns, assemble the burgers and enjoy.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/grill.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
