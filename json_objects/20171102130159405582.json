Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. The MYX Fusions Myxotica Moscato ( half-bottle) with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439091,"title":"MYX Fusions Myxotica Moscato ( half-bottle)","description":"This limited edition Myxotica Moscato was released in promotion of Nicki Minaj's third album The Pink Print.
