Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis.

It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 40 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":433677,"title":"Chimney Rock Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon ( half-bottle)","description":"Inky purple red.
