White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 27 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428231,"title":"Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay","description":"Selected from three of California's most recognized Chardonnay appellations, Sonoma, Monterey and Napa, our Ghost Pines Chardonnay offers expressive, fruit-forward characteristics.

In a small bowl combine cheese wedges, spinach, artichoke, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  Mix with a fork until well combined.  Lay your chicken breast down on a cutting board and slice it in half so you have two thin halves (see pictures).  Lay all 4 pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  Take the flat side of a meat tenderizer and pound the chicken until very thin.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken.  Scoot about 1 tablespoon of the spinach artichoke mixture on the chicken and spread it to coat the chicken.  Roll each piece of chicken and hold in place with tooth picks.  Place rolls on a baking sheet lined with tin foil and bake for 20-22 minutes. Enjoy warm!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
