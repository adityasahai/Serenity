picks for Chicken. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

Grill the chicken evenly on all sides, until juices run clear  approx. 5-6 minutes.To prepare the gravy, heat a large skillet to medium and melt the ghee/clarified butter.

Saut for a further minute or two until the mixture turns into a paste-like texture.Pour in the canned tomatoes, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze it and to release any bits stuck to the pan.

Simmer for a further 10 minutes, thickening the sauce further and to heat the chicken and cream through.Serve sprinkled with fresh chopped coriander leaves and with steamed Basmati rice, fresh naans and pickles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix all of the ingredients for the marination in a large bowl.
