Enchilada. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 42 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage. Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose. The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.","price":"$41.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438237-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/gary-farrell-russian-river-pinot-noir-2007/102829"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    To prepare the enchilada sauce. Heat oil in a small sauce pan. Cook onion until softened about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the top, cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer while you prepare the filling. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    For the filling, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in pulled pork and diced green chilies. Cook until warmed through. Turn heat to low while you prepare the tortillas.    Use enough canola oil to lightly coat the bottom of a small pan, about 2 tablespoons. Heat over medium-high heat. Cook tortillas one at a time until soft, about 30 seconds on each side. As you cook each tortilla, place them on paper towels to absorb any of the oil left over.    Lay each tortilla on a flat surface. Spoon about 1/4 cup filling into center, sprinkle with shredded Monterey jack cheese. Roll closed. Repeat with remaining filling and tortillas.    Spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place rolled tortillas in the baking dish. Spoon remaining enchilada sauce over the top. Sprinkle with shredded Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Bake 15-20 minutes or until cheese melts. Turn on broiler, broil for 3-5 minutes or until cheese browns. Remove from oven. Let cool slightly and serve with guacamole and sour cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
