Whisk in the butter and the sugar.Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry, while stirring.  Add in the shredded carrots.  Now, just like with the Chocolate Chunk Muffins post, you need to leave lumps in the batter.  Do not stir until smooth.  If you don't overmix and you leave those lumps in there, you will be rewarded with a fluffy, light, tender and soft pancake.Heat up a nonstick skillet or a griddle over medium heat and add a teaspoon of butter or oil.  Pour the the desired amount of batter into the pan (I like smaller pancakes because they are easier to flip).  Let the pancake cook until bubbles start to become visible on the surface (this usually takes 2-3 minutes).  These little bubbles tell you that it is time to flip the pancake.  Cook for another minute or so, and remove the pancake from the pan.  Repeat with the remaining batter.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sea salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to combine.In another bowl, beat the egg with a whisk and stream in the milk while whisking.","ingredients":[{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":1012047,"name":"sea salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cloves.jpg"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk in the butter and the sugar.Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry, while stirring.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add in the shredded carrots.
