Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438682,"title":"Tiamo Pinot Grigio","description":"Light straw yellow color. Fresh and rich fruity aromas of apple and pear with a hint of citrus fruit that fade into the floral bouquet.

Place salmon, skin side down, on rack and set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season salmon flesh well with salt. Chill, uncovered, 3 hours.Whisk shallot, crme frache, tarragon, and lemon zest in a small bowl to combine; taste and season with salt. Cover and chill.Crumple 2 large sheets of heavy-duty foil to form two 4\"-diameter balls. Heat skillet over medium-high, 6 minutes. Spread 2 cups wood chips in center of skillet and let char until partially blackened and smoking, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle coriander seeds, peppercorns, dill seeds, and celery seeds over chips. Carefully set rack with salmon in skillet over chips. Set foil balls on either side of fillet and push 3 skewers vertically into fillet along the bloodline about 1\" deep and 3\" apart. Loosely cover skillet with foil, using foil balls and skewers as support so there is space for smoke to circulate around the fish. Reduce heat to medium and smoke salmon 8 minutes, then reduce heat to lowest setting and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of fillet registers 120, 1015 minutes. Transfer rack with salmon back to baking sheet and let cool 30 minutes. Serve salmon at room temperature with tarragon crme frache, bagels, capers, avocados, cucumbers, watercress, and scallions alongside.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pat salmon dry, then generously coat skin and wire rack with nonstick spray.","ingredients":[{"id":15076,"name":"salmon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salmon.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405900,"name":"wire rack","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/wire-rack.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place salmon, skin side down, on rack and set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season salmon flesh well with salt.
