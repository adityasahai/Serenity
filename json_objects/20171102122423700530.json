Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Gruener Veltliner. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438867,"title":"Chateau Ste.
