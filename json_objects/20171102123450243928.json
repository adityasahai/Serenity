are great choices for Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

Stir frequently allowing them to begin to toast (3-4 minutes) at which time you will be able to smell them toasting.Add the onion, turbinado sugar, rice vinegar, dry mustard, kosher salt, pepper, mango, and jalapeno to the saucepan; stir to fully combine and bring to a light simmer.  Immediately reduce the heat and allow the pan to hit on low heat for 3-4 minutes just to combine the flavors.Remove the pan from the heat and pour contents into a blender.  Pulse on 'blend' to liquefy the mixture.With the blender on low, slowly pour the canola oil through the top of the blender lid allowing the mixture to emulsify (fully combine).  Remove from blender and either place in a sealed container in the refrigerator until using, or allow to cool to room temperature before dressing the salad.  Note: there will be leftover dressing to use on other salads.In a bowl, combine the grape slices, jicama cubes and walnut pieces.  Mix to combine.  Note: if wishing to serve chilled, this mixture may be made beforehand, sealed in a container and refrigerated.On individual plates, cover the plate with a good portion of lettuce.  Mound the grape-jicama-walnut mixture on the lettuce and spoon on dressing.  Can be served chilled or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small, heavy dry saucepan add poppy seeds over medium heat.
