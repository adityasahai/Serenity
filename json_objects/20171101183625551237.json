A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is Krohn Lágrima Fine Port. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430325,"title":"Krohn Lágrima Fine Port","description":"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine.

Add milk and process until it starts to come together. Scrape the cracker mixture into the prepared pan and pat onto the bottom.In a large mixing bowl, mix together cream cheese until smooth (about 1 minute). Add vanilla and sugar and mix well. Fold in the whipped cream or topping with a spatula. Do not over mix! Fold in until there are no streaks of the whipped cream. Spread the cheese mixture over the crust. At this point you can sprinkle it with funfetti and swirl it into the cheesecake with a knife. Place the cheesecake in the fridge and let set for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Whip the remaining half of the cup of heavy cream. Spread a thin layer of whipped cream over the top of the cheesecake. Sprinkle with funfetti. Place the rest of the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a closed star tip. Pipe out stars on the edge of the cheesecake. Decorate the side of the cheesecake with more sprinkles. Slice and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers for no more than 24 hours.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Lightly spray a 8\" round springform pan or pie pan with cooking oil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404650,"name":"springform pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/cake-pan.png"},{"id":405915,"name":"pie form","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pie-pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place whole graham crackers in food processor and process until fine.","ingredients":[{"id":18617,"name":"graham crackers","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/graham-crackers.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/food-processor.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add milk and process until it starts to come together.
