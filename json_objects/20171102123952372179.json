Stack 3 slices at a time and cut into ¼-inch strips. Cut the strips in half, if need be - you want them to be about 1½ inches long.Mix the marinade ingredients and toss with the pork strips in a small container. Cover or seal with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes at room temperature or store in the fridge up to 24 hours. (Let it sit out at room temp for 30 minutes before stir-frying).Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok, cast iron or non-stick skillet until hot, but not smoking. Pour in the eggs. Let them set for 10-15 seconds. Tilt the pan or use a spatula to push the cooked part aside and let the wet part slide out onto the hot pan. Cook another 10 seconds or so. Flip to cook the other side for just a few seconds. Quickly transfer eggs to a plate. Cut into strips and set aside.Add garlic, ginger and shiitake mushrooms to the oil left in the hot pan. Cook over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until mushrooms soften. Add cabbage and 1 teaspoons salt, and stir-fry for 3 minutes or so, until cabbage is just wilted. Scrape everything into a large bowl and set aside.Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Let the oil heat up a little. Add the pork and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes just until it loses all of its pink color. Add the scallions and stir-fry with the pork for a minute more, until they release their flavor. Add cabbage mixture and eggs back to the pan. Sprinkle on 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 3 tablespoons sherry. Toss everything together for a minute to heat. Serve hot with lettuce cups and hoisin sauce to spoon on top.
