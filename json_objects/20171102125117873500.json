If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":458665,"title":"Bellissima Sparkling Rose","description":"This is an elegant, bright rosé, with hints of strawberry and grapefruit, and a soft, persistent foam.

Toss asparagus with olive oil and place on grill. Cook until lightly charring and soft. Remove from grill and let cool slightly. Slice asparagus into strips and slice strips in half, horizontally, to fit into spring rolls.Combine orange juice, walnut oil, honey, and pinch of red chili flakes in a mason jar or other container that has a lid. Shake well and test for chilis- add more if desired.In a large bowl, toss together greens and cooked quinoa. Drizzle dressing over and toss until mixture is coated.Set up a rolling station with grilled asparagus, quinoa mixture, rice papers, a dish of hot water larger enough to hold the spring rolls, and a cutting board.Soak the rice paper for 10-15 seconds (you don’t want it too soft when taking it out of the water but pliable enough to roll.) Place rice paper on a cutting board and load with quinoa mixture and grilled asparagus. Roll, tuck, and fold in sides as you go. Continue with remaining ingredients.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Light grill. Toss asparagus with olive oil and place on grill.
