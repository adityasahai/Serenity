Introduce the mayonnaise next, followed the remaining flour mixture. Continue to mix slowly while drizzling in the first 2 tablespoons of milk alternative until it forms smooth, homogeneous dough.Divide the dough in half, and flatten out one of the balls into a smooth disk, wrapping it up in plastic and stashing it in the fridge.Take the remaining half of dough thats still in the mixing bowl and add in the cocoa powder and remaining 1 tablespoon of milk alternative. Mix thoroughly to incorporate. Once smooth, flatten and wrap the dough out in the same manner as before, storing it in the fridge to chill for at least one 1 hour before proceeding.When youre ready to roll, preheat your oven to 350F and line two or three baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.Youll need a fair amount of space to execute these shapes, so clear off a large expanse of a flat, clean counter. Lightly flour the surface and begin by rolling out the disk of plain speculoos dough first. The exact size of the rectangle isnt critical as long as its more or less even; whats more important is to aim for a thickness of about th of an inch. Use a flat spatula to carefully scrape beneath the rectangle, ensuring that it hasnt adhered to the counter, and quickly move on to the chocolate dough. The longer it sits, the stickier it gets, so make haste! Repeat the same procedure but keep the chocolate rectangle about a half-inch shorter than the first.Very gently slide the thin chocolate rectangle on top of the plain one, lining up the short ends on one side. There should be a small amount of uncovered plain dough at the opposite end. Starting where the doughs line up perfectly, begin to roll them together in as tight as cylinder as possible. Pinch the plain dough together at the very end, using a tiny dab of water if needed to create a seal. If the dough has become very soft while you were working with it, stash the whole roll in the freezer for just 10 minutes to firm it back up.Using a very sharp knife, slice the cookie log into -inch thick cookies. Transfer them to your prepared sheets, allowing at least a -inch of space between them for more even baking. The first and last cookies cut from the ends will be funny shapes, but dont worry; Consider them taste-testers for the baker!Bake for 10  14 minutes, until just barely golden brown around the edges and no longer glossy. Be careful not to over-bake them in if you want softer, chewier cookies. Immediately pull the silpats off the hot baking sheets as soon as they come out of the oven, and let them rest there until completely cool. Store in an air-tight container for up to two weeks, or move them into the freezer to keep them fresh for up to three months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Use your stand mixer to thoroughly cream the margarine, speculoos spread, and sugar together, beating them with the paddle attachment until perfectly smooth.In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, ground flaxseeds, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon, making sure that all the dry goods are well-distributed.","ingredients":[{"id":12220,"name":"ground flaxseed","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flax-seeds.jpg"},{"id":99011,"name":"cookie butter","image":null},{"id":18371,"name":"baking powder","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add about half of the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl, mixing until fully incorporated.
