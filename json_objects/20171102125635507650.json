To make the strawberry sauce, combine strawberries, sugar and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 6-10 minutes. Keep warm; set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, butter, sour cream and eggs. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula just until moist. Lightly coat a griddle or nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Scoop 1/3 cup batter for each pancake and cook until bubbles appear on top and the underside is nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook pancakes on the other side, about 1-2 minutes longer; keep warm in oven.
