A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Line a baking sheet with parchment, and coat lightly with cooking spray.                          Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the marshmallows, honey, vanilla and a pinch of salt, and stir with the prepared wooden spoon until the marshmallows have completely melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the cereal and stir until the mixture is fully combined.                          Use the prepared measuring cup to scoop out the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in mounds. Let them cool for a few seconds to make them easier to work with. Spray your hands with cooking spray, and firmly press and pat each mound into a football shape. Let the treats sit at room temperature to harden slightly, about 20 minutes.                          Cut the candy chews lengthwise into quarters. Roll the pieces into thin ropes and cut into short and long lengths to make laces. Arrange the candy on top of each football, pressing in to help them adhere. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Coat a wooden spoon and 1/3-cup dry measuring cup with cooking spray.
