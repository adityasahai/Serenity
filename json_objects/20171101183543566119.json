A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Toss the apples in a large bowl with the zest and juice of the lemon, the walnuts, and the cinnamon.  Pulse together the flour, baking powder, salt, almonds, and 11/4 cups of the sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. With the food processor running, add the eggs, oil, and almond extract, processing until just mixed.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Spoon 1/3 of the batter over the bottom of the pan.  Scatter the apples on top, and cover the apples with the remaining batter.  Sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar (you’ll need less if using a Bundt pan).  Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.  The cake will take a shorter time to bake in the shallow rectangular pan than in the Bundt pan.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°F, and grease a Bundt pan or a 9- by-13- inch baking pan.
