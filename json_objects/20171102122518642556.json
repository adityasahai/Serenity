Combine sugar, butter, water and corn syrup in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve sugar and melt butter. Bring to a boil, stirring only once or twice to prevent sticking and burning (frequent stirring causes the toffee to crystallize), and continue to cook until the mixture reaches a temperature of 360°F and becomes dark caramel in color, about 12 minutes. Use a digital thermometer for an accurate temperature reading of the mixture.2. Remove from heat and wait about 10 seconds for the bubbles in the mixture to dissapate, then use a heat-resistant silicone spatula (the back of the spatula usually indicates heat resistance) or a wooden spoon to fold in 1 cup of the almonds. Pour the mixture into a baking sheet with sides, and use the spatula to spread the mixture out evenly (it will not stick to the pan). Cool the toffee at room temperature for 10 minutes, then refrigerate for 20 minutes.3. Remove toffee from refrigerator. Use an offset spatula to spread the melted chocolate over the surface of the toffee, then sprinkle the remaining cup of almonds over the surface of the melted chocolate. Refrigerate the toffee for about 30 minutes, until hard, then break into pieces. Store in a tightly sealed plastic container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine sugar, butter, water and corn syrup in a large saucepan over medium heat.
