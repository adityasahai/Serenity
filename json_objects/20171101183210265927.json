A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Press half the dough into the bottom of a 9x13 pan that has been sprayed with non stick spray. The dough will be sticky, but keep pressing until it is evenly spread on the bottom of the pan. Non stick spray on your hands also helps.Beat the cream cheese and sugar until creamy. Add the egg and beat again. Spread over the dough in the pan.Place the strawberry preserves in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. Drop by small spoonfuls all over the top of the cheesecake layer. Very carefully drag a knife through the cheesecake to swirl in the strawberry preserves.Take small pieces of the remaining dough and press flat in the palm of your hand. Place the pieces over the top of the cheesecake. Cover as much of the cheesecake as you can. There will be some places where the cheesecake will still show and that's ok. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Refrigerate until completely chilled.Stir together the powdered sugar and lemon juice. Drizzle over the chilled bars. Top with sprinkles. Let set. Cut into 24 bars. Keep refrigerated in a sealed container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Beat together the dry cake mix, the butter, and lemonade until a soft dough forms.
