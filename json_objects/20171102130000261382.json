A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast.

Blend until very smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and add in the vanilla bean. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sauce starts to form tiny bubbles around the edges and begins to thicken. Do NOT let this come to a boil–you want to warm it to cook the egg and thicken the sauce. When the custard is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove it from heat and fish out the vanilla bean.Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Add the cream of tartar and remaining honey and vanilla extract to the egg whites. Beat until stiff peaks form. Use a rubber spatula to mound the egg whites into six rounds on the parchment paper–they will retain the shape they have when they go into the oven, so shape them as desired before you bake them. Bake for 20 minutes, or until they are just set and light golden.To serve, spoon some of the custard into a serving dish, and use a spatula to carefully remove a meringue and place it on top of the custard. Top with some of the toasted almonds, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Separate the eggs, placing the whites in a bowl suitable for whisking them to stiff peaks.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the egg yolks, coconut milk, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons raw honey, and pinch of salt in a blender.
