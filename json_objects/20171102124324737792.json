Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook pasta according to package directions and allow to cool.Combine zucchini, tomatoes and red onion.Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and basil in a bowl and then toss with pasta.Combine pasta and vegetables, then add pepitas and Parmesan cheese.Chill for 30 minutes and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook pasta according to package directions and allow to cool.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine zucchini, tomatoes and red onion.","ingredients":[{"id":10011282,"name":"red onion","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-onion.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and basil in a bowl and then toss with pasta.","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":2044,"name":"basil","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Combine pasta and vegetables, then add pepitas and Parmesan cheese.Chill for 30 minutes and serve.","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg"},{"id":10012014,"name":"raw pumpkin seeds","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pumpkin-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]}]}
