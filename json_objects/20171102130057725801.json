Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle) with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449340,"title":"St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle)","description":"This is a complex wine that reflects the heat of the afternoon sun, the cool, windy evenings, and the rustic soils of the McMinnville hills while retaining the dark beauty of its intense, ripe fruit. It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate. Ample ripe tannins balance with its acidity.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449340-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/st-innocent-momtazi-hill-pinot-noir-375ml-half-bottle-2014/167614"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 425 F degrees.Mix the chicken with 8 oz of the green chile enchilada sauce, the green chiles and half of the Monterey Jack cheese.In another bowl, stir together the remaining enchilada sauce and the sour cream.
