A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

While whipping, beat in the granulated sugar until very stiff and firm, about 2 minutes.Fold the dry ingredients, in two batches, into the beaten egg whites with a rubber spatula. When the mixture is smooth and there are no streaks of egg white, stop folding and scrape the batter into the pastry bag. (standing the bag in a tall glass helps if you’re alone).Pipe the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheets in 1-inch (3 cm) circles (about 1 tablespoon each of batter), evenly spaced one-inch (3 cm) apart.Rap the baking sheet a few times firmly on the counter top to flatten the macarons and sprinkle espresso in top of each. Let them rest at room temperature. A skin needs to form, and it can take 30-90 minutes, depending on the weather. If you touch them lightly and the top has dried, and nothing sticks to your finger, they’re ready to bake. Bake them for 15-18 minutes. Let cool completely then remove from baking sheet.To make the chocolate filling: Heat the cream in a small saucepan. When the cream just begins to boil at the edges, remove from heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let sit one minute, then stir until smooth. Stir in the pieces of butter. Let cool completely before using.Spread a bit of batter on the inside of the macarons then sandwich them together.Let them stand at least one day before serving, to meld the flavors.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 340ºF (170ºC).Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 2 cm) ready.Grind together the powdered sugar with the almond powder and cappuccino powder so there are no lumps; use a blender or food processor. Using a mixer beat the egg whites until they begin to rise and hold their shape.
