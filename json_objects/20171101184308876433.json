extract, sugar and honey into a small food processor. Blend until smooth, creamy and well combined.Transfer to a small bowl, cover and refrigerate to let set at least 2 hours.To make the crepes:Place all the crepe ingredients in a blender and blend until well combined.Refrigerate the batter for at least one hour to allow the flour to hydrate. Don't skip this, and the longer the better.To cook the crepes:Lightly spray a crepe pan (or a small pan) with cooking spray and heat to medium heat.Pour a scant ¼ cup of the batter in the middle of heated pan, swirling around so that the batter goes all the way to the outside.Cook until the outside edges become lightly crisp and just begin to roll from the sides, and the underneath is golden brown, about 1 minutes.Gently flip (I used a crepe lifter and then flipped quickly with my fingers so I didn't burn them) and then cook an additional 30-40 seconds on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter. *To make the strawberry sauce:While the crepes are cooking combine the strawberries and sugar in a large pan on medium heat. Cook until the strawberries begin to soften, about 5-6 minutes, stiring occasionally.Once the strawberries are soft, slightly mash with a fork. Don't mash too much, as you want some texture.Boil an additional 5-7 minutes, until the sauce reduces and slightly thickens.To serve:Fill each crepe with the ricotta filling, roll up and top with strawberry sauce.DEVOUR","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the whipped ricotta","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, lemon juice and zest, vanilla extract, sugar and honey into a small food processor.
