After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428399,"title":"Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot","description":"Working without sourcing constraints, our winemakers selected Merlot clusters contributing layered flavors of dark berries, licorice and espresso alongside lots of richness, full-bodied structure, and desirable length. In addition to these flavors, you'll taste hints of cigar paper, cocoa, caramel and nutmeg wrapped around a remarkably smooth mid-palate full of velvety texture and depth. On the long finish, you'll find suggestions of toasty oak, mouth-filling black fruit, and cola framed by plush tannins.","price":"$26.65","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428399-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Pines-County-Sonoma-Merlot/dp/B01A8WOVRW"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees.Rub the potatoes with oil and 1/2 teaspoon seasoning.
