Let ingredients rest on a counter for 10 minutes. In a large bow (I use my 6 quart kitchen aid) combine eggs together with milk, sugar, oil, vanilla and sour cream, whisking ingredients each time. Add yeast mixture and one cup of flour into the ingredients, in a large bowl. Whisk everything together, cover with a towel  and let it rest in a warm place for an hour. Mix in flour by thirds using Kitchen aid mixer or your hands. Knead the dough until it is elastic, or at least for 10 minutes. Let dough rise for an hour.Make small balls out of the dough. Use oil to prevent dough from sticking to your hands. Too much oil on the dough may prevent piroshki from sealing. Flatten out dough and place filling inside. Fold over the sides and pinch the edges together to seal the dough. SIDE NOTE... Yeah, I am way overdue for a manicure. lol :)Using a deep pan, fill it up with lots of oil. Keep stove top on medium/low heat, while frying. Fry each of the piroshki, until they are golden brown on each side. Break one apart to see if it's cooked through. Lay them out on a paper towel, allowing the paper towel to absorb oil.I have only made poppy seed filling in a Vitamix blender and it worked great for me. Soak poppy seeds in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain out all water from poppy seeds, combine them together with condensed milk and sugar. Blend for about 30 seconds or until texture is smooth.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine yeast together with half a cup of warm milk and one tablespoons of sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/yeast.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Let ingredients rest on a counter for 10 minutes.
