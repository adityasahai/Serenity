vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Stirring ocassionally, heat the blood orange juice and sugar together on medium until the juice is reduced to about  cup. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely to room temperature. Once at room temperature, place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour.Heat the milk, heavy cream, half the suagr, and the salt together in a saucepan until it reaches a light boil. Stir frequently. Once at a boil, turn down the heat.In a separate bowl, mix together the egg yolks, egg, remaining suagr, and cornstarch until light in color.Whisk the egg mixture constantly as you slowly pour  of the hot milk into the eggs. Quickly begin whisking the remaining milk in your saucepan and slowly stir in the eg mixture. Put the saucepan on the stove on medium-low heat. Continue to stir until the mixture is thickened and smooth.Put the pastry cream through a fine mesh strainer over a bowl to remove any lumps. Stir in the butter and vanilla extract.Place plastic wrap directly on the pastry cream and place in the refrigerator to cool completely - at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Once you are ready to use, stir in the blood orange syrup. Both the syrup and the pastry cream can be made a day ahead.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Heat the water and butter together in a saucepan over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is steaming. Remove from heat.Mix in the salt, flour, and sugar and mix in well until the dough forms a ball. Allow to cool about 5 minutes, then beat in the eggs one at a time until combined. It may seem as though it will never happen, but keep mixing and it will eventually incorporate.Fill a piping bag with the pate choux and pipe out large rounds of the dough - about 1 inches in diameter at least 2 inches apart. Use a moistened finger to pat down any points in your dough.Bake for 20 minutes, turning halfway through. Allow to cool completely.Fill a piping bag fitted with a small round tip with the pastry cream. Use the piping tip to make a hole on the side or under the puff and fill with the pastry cream.Mix together the chocolate and the heavy cream and heat in a microwave at 50% power for 30 second intervals, mixing well between each interval. Once the chocolate is melted, mix well.Dip the tops of the cream puffs in the ganache and allow to dry on a wire rack. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Stirring ocassionally, heat the blood orange juice and sugar together on medium until the juice is reduced to about  cup.","ingredients":[{"id":1009206,"name":"blood orange juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/blood-orange-juice.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and allow to cool completely to room temperature.
