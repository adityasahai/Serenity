White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

In a medium bowl, combine the drained tomatoes with the olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir well, then set the tomato mixture aside. Preheat the oven to 400F.Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to carefully pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness. Don't pound with too much force or the breasts may split. Start at the thickest part of the breast and work your way out toward the edges. Once pounded, slice each chicken breast into two portions and season each side with a pinch of salt and pepper.Drain the can of artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Place a handful of the artichoke pieces in the bottom of a casserole dish, then lay the chicken pieces over top. Cover the chicken with the remaining artichoke pieces. Pour the tomato mixture over top.Bake the chicken, uncovered, in the fully preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, sprinkle one cup of mozzarella over top. Switch oven's setting from bake to broil and broil the dish (on the middle rack) for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and browned. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Drain the diced tomatoes.
