large dutch oven or sauce pot over medium-heat until shimmering. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low, cover, and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the onions are quite soft and translucent, and beginning to release some moisture.Uncover, turn the heat back up to medium, and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the onions are golden brown and most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir regularly, and turn the heat down if the onions start to burn. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, and let cool to room-temperature.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, form the meatballs: Add the ground chicken to the cooled caramelized onions, and stir to combine. Stir in the egg yolk.In a separate bowl, stir together the herbs, spices, breadcrumbs and cheese until well-mixed. Add to the chicken mixture, followed by the cream, and use your fingers to gently mix until evenly combined. Wash your hands, coat with a bit of olive oil, then roll the chicken into 1-inch balls (slightly smaller than golf balls). Place them in rows on a silicone baking mat or parchment paper-lined sheet pan, about an inch and a half apart. You should end up with 14-15 meatballs.Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until nicely browned and cooked through. Let simmer for another 5-10 minutes in the soup before serving (see below).Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and leek, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened. Add the garlic, and cook for another minute or two. Add the butter, and as it melts, stir in the herbs. Let cook for another minute or two, until the onions are lightly golden.Add the lemon juice, followed by the stock, and stir to combined. Cover, and bring the stock to a boil, then turn the heat down to low, and let simmer uncovered for about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Add the meatballs, and continue to simmer until cooked through, about 5-10 minutes, then add the kale and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes until warmed through and just beginning to wilt. If using a more delicate green, such as spinach, add right before serving. Serve warm with crusty bread and a light dusting of Parmesan.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Transfer to a large mixing bowl, and let cool to room-temperature.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
