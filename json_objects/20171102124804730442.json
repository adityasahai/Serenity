If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. The Bellissima Sparkling rosé with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

I really like runny yolks, especially in this quesadilla because of the way the yolk mixes with the creamed spinach and melted cheese. To accomplish this, make sure your skillet is nice and hot before adding the egg. Fry it on one side until the whites are mostly set and the yolk is still runny. Briefly flip the egg over and fry for 30 seconds or so. This will finish setting the top of the whites and create a skin on top of the yolk leaving the inside still runny! YUM!Spread the creamed spinach (its okay if its cold from the fridge) over one side of the tortilla. Sprinkle the 2 Tbsp of cheddar cheese over the creamed spinach. Place the cooked egg on top of both and fold the other side of the tortilla over top of the fillings.Place the folded tortilla in the hot skillet that you used for frying the egg (keep the heat on). Cook the quesadilla on each side until it is golden brown and crsipy. Serve immdiately!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small skillet, fry the egg.
