A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue. With butterscotch and pecan aromas, the sweet salted nut and brown spice aromas carry a complex caramel accent.

Mix the sugar, baking soda and flour together.Whip the eggs and one yolk in a bowl, add the lemon juice and rind, then add the dry ingredients in.I added the extra yolk to make the filling more creamy.Pour the filling on the crust. Bake in a 325 degree oven until the middle is set. The lower temperature makes the top end up a lot less brown, as most recipes tell you at the end to cover the too-browned top with icing sugar.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Kick the tires and light the fires to 325 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the flour and sugar then cut the butter in.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the lemon zest.Or, continue on with the filling.","ingredients":[{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zest-lemon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Mix the sugar, baking soda and flour together.Whip the eggs and one yolk in a bowl, add the lemon juice and rind, then add the dry ingredients in.I added the extra yolk to make the filling more creamy.","ingredients":[{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Pour the filling on the crust.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Bake in a 325 degree oven until the middle is set.
