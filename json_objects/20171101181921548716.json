A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry.

Place 24 cupcake liners in muffin tins. Beat the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, water, and oil in a mixing bowl.  Beat the mixture for 1 minute on low speed, and then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Spoon the batter evenly into the cupcake liners. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out mostly clean. Let cool completely. Beat the cream cheese and sugar until creamy.  Add the pumpkin and cinnamon and beat again. Fold the Cool Whip into the pumpkin mixture gently.  Add some orange food coloring if you want a brighter orange center. Cut out the center of the cooled cupcakes using a cupcake corer or a small paring knife. Fill the center of each cupcake with the pumpkin cream. Beat the butter, salt, and vanilla until creamy.  Slowly add the powdered sugar and heavy whipping cream until everything is mixed in.  Beat on high for 1-2 minutes until light and fluffy. Spread or pipe the frosting on top of the cupcakes.  Top with sprinkles.  Makes 24 cupcakes.
