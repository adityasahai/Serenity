Allow muffins to cool for about 5 minutes.While the muffins are cooling, prepare the topping. Melt 3 Tablespoons of butter for about 30 seconds in a small bowl in the microwave. Stir and stick back in microwave if not fully melted. Pour the powdered sugar in a separate small bowl. Fully submerge each muffin into the melted butter and then into the powdered sugar. Coat all sides generously and evenly with powdered sugar. Use more melted butter or powdered sugar if needed. Set upright on cooling rack. Donut muffins taste best eaten on the same day. They will stay fresh in an airtight container for up to 1 week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400F.
