A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430034,"title":"NV Mission Mountain Winery Cocoa Vin Port","description":"An amazing after dinner aperitif.
