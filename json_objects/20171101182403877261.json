Cook it in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds or so, until fully melted, and then mix it into the biscuit mixture - work fairly quickly before the chocolate begins to cool.When well mixed, spread half of the biscuit mixture into the dish, pressing down firmly to help it pack together.Melt the milk chocolate in the microwave, and drizzle just under half of it over the biscuit mixture - if possible, try to make sure that most of the biscuit mixture is covered (this helps it all to stick together nicely, as well as creating an extra chocolatey layer in the middle of your tiffin).Add the remaining biscuit mixture, and again spread out in a single layer. Top with the remaining milk chocolate, and use the back of a spoon to spread it out into an even layer.Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours until completely set. Remove from the fridge 5-10 minutes before serving, to allow it to soften slightly and make cutting easier.
