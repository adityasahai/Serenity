Add the yellow onion, green onions, and garlic and stir to blend well. Add the short ribs and turn to coat well with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours or, preferably, 24 hours.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Line a large, heavy-duty baking sheet with foil.
