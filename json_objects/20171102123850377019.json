Lasagna pairs well with medium-bodied red wine with higher acidity. Sangiovese, Montepulciano, and Chianti all fit the bill. The Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

This rich 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is made from the oldest estate vineyards,planted back in 1975 on soils rich in chalk, clay and pebbles. Harvested by hand in the second partof October, the grapes are gently pressed and macerated with the skins for 1012days to ensureideal color concentration and structure. After full malolactic fermentation in barrels, the wine ismatured for one more year in the same French barriques and then refined in bottle for another eightmonths.Valle Reale introduces the wine lover to a new breed of Montepulciano. Surprisingly concentrated,with silky tannins and layers of dark berry fruit and spices, this is a rich and aromatic Montepulcianod'Abruzzo. Fullbodiedand firm, yet supple, it is ready to be enjoyed with hearty pasta dishes,roasted poultry or lamb, and ribs.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/447010-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/valle-reale-vigneto-di-popoli-montepulciano-dabruzzo-2006/104761"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees.Toss chopped vegetables, except for spinach, with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.Place vegetables on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray and cook for about 20 minutes or until tender.Cook lasagna noodles according directions.Cool vegetables slightly and combine with 1 3/4 cups of pasta sauce.In a separate bowl combine ricotta, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, egg and garlic.
