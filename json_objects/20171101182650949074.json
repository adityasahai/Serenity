A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Line the bottom and sides of an 8x8\" square baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment, leaving an overhang on all sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan before cutting. Set aside.    Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine coconut flour and salt. Stir in maple syrup and mix until fully combined. Add coconut oil and mix until dough forms, pressing out any clumps of coconut oil. Pat with your hands to bring the dough fully together then press evenly into prepared pan. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.    Make the filling: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the eggs and maple syrup until smooth and combined. Next slowly whisk in the coconut flour until blended in well. Then finally, add in the lemon juice and lemon zest, mixing very well and no lumps appear.Pour custard into cooled crust and bake until just set and the center jiggles very slightly, about 20 to 25 minutes Be careful NOT to OVERBAKE. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 30 minutes.Place in the refrigerator to chill until firm, about 2 hours and up to overnight.     Once chilled, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides and cut into squares.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F.
