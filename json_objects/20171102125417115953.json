White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428720,"title":"Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay","description":"Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.","price":"$15.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428720-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Downton-Abbey-Countess-Grantham-Chardonnay/dp/B00TXUZYEU"}]},"instructions":"In a medium bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and cracked black pepper.  Pour into a large ziplock bag and add chicken drumsticks. Shake to coat chicken and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, giving the bag a shake whenever you think about it. Preheat oven to 400째F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a Cooling Rack on top. Remove the chicken from the bag, reserving the marinade, and place the drumsticks on the rack. Bake the drumsticks, on the middle oven rack, for 25 minutes. While the chicken is baking, place the leftover marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the marinade to a boil, then reduce the heat to a slow simmer.  Cook over low heat, stirring as needed, for about 15 minutes or until thickened. Remove drumsticks from oven (after first 25 minutes of cooking) and heavily coat with the thickened marinade, using a silicone pastry brush. Return to the oven and cook for 10 more minutes. Coat the drumsticks again and return to oven to cook for 5 more minutes, or until an internal temperate of 160째F is reached. Coat the drumsticks one last time, with any remaining sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds and parsley. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and cracked black pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/brown-sugar-dark.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/honey.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour into a large ziplock bag and add chicken drumsticks.
