Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. The Domus Aurea Cabernet Sauvignon with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440143,"title":"Domus Aurea Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Aurea is a blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, and 7% Cabernet Franc. It has a dazzling ruby hue and a fresh, balsamic nose with an elegant body and complex flavors of spicy red fruit, herbs and licorice.Outstanding with grilled poultry, mushrooms and sweet red peppers.\"One of the most idiosyncratic wines from Chile, Domus grows high up the Andean foothills in the outskirts of Santiago. The vines are refreshed by winds coming off the mountains, and capture an Andean character of eucalyptus and herbal aromas in their grapes. The wine feels soft and round, with bright acidity and a generous core of red fruit. It finishes with hints of leather and mocha. Delicious now, this will age with grace.\"-Wines & Spirits\"Alluring, with mint, sage and warm cocoa aromas leading the way for dried currant, licorice, loam and coffee notes. There's plenty of grip, particularly for a 2004, with extra waves of currant and mint on the lengthy finish.\"-Wine Spectator","price":"$39.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440143-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.wine.com/product/domus-aurea-cabernet-sauvignon-2004/94739"}]},"instructions":"Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
