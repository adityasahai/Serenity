White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color.

The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken broth, onions, carrots, celery, minced garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper, stirring to combine.Rinse the chicken, trim any excess fat from the cavity and place it in the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and cook the chicken on LOW for 8 to 9 hours or on HIGH for 4 to 5 hours until the chicken is cooked throughout and has reached an internal temperature of 165F.Transfer the chicken from the slow cooker to a cutting board. Remove the bay leaves from the slow cooker. Turn off the slow cooker and skim any fat from the top of the soup. (See Kelly's Note.)Add the noodles, stirring to combine. Allow the noodles to cook just until al dente, about 20 minutes. While the noodles cook, remove the skin, fat and bones from the chicken and shred the meat. Once the noodles are cooked, return the chicken to the slow cooker, stirring to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper then serve.Kelly's Note:There are a variety of ways to skim the excess fat from the soup. If time permits, refrigerate the soup to allow the fat to congeal on top of the soup then simply scoop it off. If you're serving the soup right away, allow the fat to collect on the top then skim it off with a spoon or place a paper towel lightly on top to soak up the fat.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken broth, onions, carrots, celery, minced garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper, stirring to combine.Rinse the chicken, trim any excess fat from the cavity and place it in the slow cooker.
