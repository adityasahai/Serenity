One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.", u'title': u"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir", u'price': u'$47.99', u'id': 465202, u'link': u'https://www.wine.com/product/bernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011/131978', u'imageUrl': u'https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg'}]}, u'aggregateLikes': 5623, u'instructions': u'Bring a large skillet over medium heat and cook the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon until browned.
