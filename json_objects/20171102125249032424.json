Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. One wine you could try is Billecart-Salmon Brut rosé ( Magnum). It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 170 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":457927,"title":"Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose ( Magnum)","description":"Persistent mousse, with fine bubbles rising slowly.

Add the garlic, zucchini, tomatoes, and corn kernels to a cast iron skillet along with the cumin, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Saut the vegetables over medium heat until the tomatoes have broken down and most of the moisture has evaporated off the bottom of the skillet.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together six large eggs and  cup of milk.Once the vegetables have cooked down and most of their juices have evaporated from the skillet, sprinkle the Monterrey jack cheese over top. Pour the egg and milk mixture into the skillet. Move the vegetables around slightly with a fork or spoon to let the egg run underneath them.Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and puffy. After baking, slice the frittata into six pieces and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mince the garlic and dice the zucchini and tomatoes.","ingredients":[{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/tomato.jpg"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/zucchini.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the garlic, zucchini, tomatoes, and corn kernels to a cast iron skillet along with the cumin, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper.
