Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438867,"title":"Chateau Ste.

September harvest conditions were ideal with very warm, clear days and cool nights.\"Fresh pear, honeydew melon and mandarin orange aromas and flavors combine with chamomile tea, honeysuckle and assorted floral characteristics...\" according to winemaker, Erik Olsen.

If necessary, scrape down the sides of the blender and process again. Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Before beginning the next step, pulse the mixture briefly in the blender again.Heat a 12” nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Brush a small amount of butter or coconut oil onto the skillet. While holding the skillet away from the heat, quickly pour about 1/3 cup of the crepe batter onto the skillet, tilting it so that the batter coats the bottom in a thin layer. Return the skillet to the stovetop. Allow the crepe to cook for about 2 minutes, or until set. Carefully lift the crepe with a rubber spatula, grab it by your fingertips, and gently (but quickly!) flip it over. Allow the opposite side to cook for 30-60 seconds, until browned. Remove the crepe from the pan and transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining crepe batter, stacking the finished crepes on top of each other. (Note, you will probably only need to brush the skillet with butter or oil at the beginning, not in between each crepe.)Prepare the filling:Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add red peppers and spinach; sauté 1 more minute. Increase heat to medium-high.In a bowl, whisk together the milk and arrowroot starch until smooth. Pour the mixture into the skillet and heat until bubbly. Add the crumbled goat cheese, stirring until melted. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 3 minutes, until slightly thickened. Reduce heat and stir in the shrimp and black pepper, until heated through.Assembly:Warm the crepes in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. Spoon about 1/3 cup of filling onto the center of each crepe, roll up, and transfer to serving plates. Spoon additional filling over the crepes.</p>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Make the crepes","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine all ingredients in a blender and process for about one minute, until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain.
