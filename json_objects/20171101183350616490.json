Try pairing with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Butter and flour two 9\" round cake pans.In a medium bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, coffee, sour cream, and vanilla. It will make a gorgeous shiny fudge.In a large bowl beat the butter until smooth and shiny. Add the sugars and continue beating until fluffy, and then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing between each addition.In another bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Add it to the butter in thirds, alternating with the fudge mixture, scraping down the bowl several times as you go.Divide the batter between the two prepared cake pans and bake for 25 - 30 mins. A pick inserted into the center will come out clean.Let the cakes cool before turning them out on a wire rack to cool completely.To make the chocolate buttercream, beat the butter until smooth. Whisk together the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Add it a cup at a time to the butter, mixing well in between each addition. When the mixture is too dry to add any more of the powdered sugar, add the vanilla and milk, and sprinkle in the salt. Add the remaining powdered sugar/cocoa and beat the frosting on high until fluffy and smooth.
