Sift the almond flour last, discarding of any large lumps that remain in the sieve. You should have about 2 tablespoons left over.

Mixon high for 10seconds,until smooth.With the mixer running, incorporate the dry ingredients a little at at time. Add the melted coconut oil last then allow to mix for about 15-20 seconds, until no large lumps remain. Use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure all of the ingredients have been incorporated.Using a scooper, scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of the batter at a time and place on the lined baking sheet about 2-inches apart. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes. Set aside to cool for at least an hour before icing. They will firm up as they cool.Meanwhile make the cashew cream by combining the soaked and drained cashews with the remaining ingredients in a high speed blender. Blend until smooth, adding more maple syrup to sweeten, as needed.Transfer the cream into a pastry bag or a plastic bag with one end cut off.
