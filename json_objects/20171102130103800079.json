Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. One wine you could try is Poet's Leap Riesling. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":445345,"title":"Poet's Leap Riesling","description":"Key lime and fresh citrus peel aromas give way to vivid layers of white peach and stone fruit flavors accented by a pleasant touch of minerality.
