After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Sterling Vineyards Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428278,"title":"Sterling Vineyards Merlot","description":null,"price":"$28.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428278-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Sterling-Vineyards-Valley-Merlot/dp/B071FP8NPG"}]},"instructions":"Chop the onion finely. With the knife tip pointing toward the root, slice the onion to within ½ inch of the base. Make about ¼ inch parallel cuts. Then slice the onion horizontally about ¼ inch parallel cuts. Then cut perpendicular to the first slices you made. If the onions need to be chopped finer, you can run your knife through them in a rocking motion. Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife, otherwise the onions are going to go flying around the room.Heat oil in a large pan over medium high heat and sauté the onion until translucent. Season with salt and pepper.Transfer to a large bowl and let it cool.Add the meat in the bowl and mix all together.Add an egg, milk, Panko, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg.Mix the meat well with your hands until the mixture gets sticky. If you want to keep your hands clean, use rubber gloves or use plastic bags.Pinch off 2 inch from the mixture and make 4 large patties (or 6 medium patties). Toss each ball from one hand to the other hand repeatedly about 5 times in order to release air inside the balls (see the video link above). The hamburger steaks will crack while cooking if you don’t release the air inside.Make oval shape patties. The top shouldn’t be flat, more like round. Keep in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the meat combines together.In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat and place the patties gently on the pan. Indent the center of each patty with 2 fingers because the center of patties will rise with heat.Cook the patties about 5 minutes. Do not flip until nicely browned.After you flip, pour red wine and lower heat to medium low heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes to thoroughly cook the inside of the patties (adjust cooking time depending on thickness).Then uncover and increase heat to medium high to let the red wine evaporate. When it’s almost gone, transfer steaks into individual plates. Do not wash the pan.Combine the liquid sauce ingredients in a bowl.In the same pan (without cleaning), add butter and sauce ingredients and mix well.Lower the heat to medium low and let it simmer for a few minutes until alcohol smell is gone. While simmering, you can skim off the scum and fat.When the sauce thickens, pour the sauce over the hamburger steaks. Serve the hamburger steak with vegetables over your favorite side dish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Chop the onion finely.
