Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, all spice, and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until all pieces are small.In a separate bowl, whisk the cream, molasses, and vanilla extract together well. Pour into the dry ingredients and fold in with a spatula until the liquid is absorbed; the dough will still be very shaggy. Use your hands to knead just until you can clump the entire mixture into a single ball of dough. This will take some time so be patient, but if necessary, you can add more cream about 1 teaspoon at a time to bring the dough together. Divide dough in half and flatten each half into a round disc about 3/4\"-1\" thick on one of the prepared baking sheets. Freeze for 1 hour.* Preheat oven to 400F. Just before baking, remove scone dough from freezer and slice each round into 8 equal pieces. Divide scones evenly between the two baking sheets, spread out. Brush tops with cream and sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar and sparkling sugar. Bake scones in preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, flipping and rotating halfway through. Scones are done when a toothpick inserted into the center of one comes out clean.Cool scones on a wire rack until ready to serve.
