Add the marinated beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes Add 1 cup water and close pressure cooker.

Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add green chillis and stir until fragrant-about 2 minutes. Add red chilli and turmeric powder and stir vigorously, so as not to burn the spices and cook for 1 minute. If they tend to stick or discolor add a few drops of water. Add the bacon and stir until the bacon begins to render, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cook, stirring, until the oil is fragrant and separates from the mixture, about 5 minutes. Add water, bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. Return the beef and its juices to the pot and allow the whole dish to cook for another 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt if necessary, and serve with bread or rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine meat, ginger paste, garlic paste, pepper, vinegar, and 2 teaspoons salt.","ingredients":[{"id":10111215,"name":"garlic paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":93754,"name":"ginger paste","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ginger-garlic-paste.png"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"2","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in pressure cooker on medium high heat until shimmering.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404658,"name":"pressure cooker","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pressure-cooker.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add cloves and cinnamon and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Add the marinated beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Add 1 cup water and close pressure cooker.
