Try pairing with Port, Moscato d'Asti, and Cream Sherry. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The Sandeman Vintage Port with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 135 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430502,"title":"Sandeman Vintage Port","description":null,"price":"$135.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430502-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/1970-Sandeman-Vintage-Port-750/dp/B00FH1O8KK"}]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, combine the milk, cream, sugar, salt, vanilla, strawberries, and food coloring.
