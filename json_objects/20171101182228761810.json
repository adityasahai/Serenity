Remove from heat and allow to rest until cool, 10 - 15 minutes.Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 30 seconds, set aside. In a seperate mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whip together 1/2 cup light-brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, eggs and vanilla on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, fold and stir in melted chocolate mixture. Working in 3 seperate batches, add 1/3 of the flour mixture and fold just until combined. Chill dough about 45 minutes (until it holds it's shape), preheating oven to 325 degrees during the last 10 minutes of chilling. Scoop dough out by the heaping tablespoonfuls, shape into balls with buttered hands and drop onto Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake in preheated oven 12 - 13 minutes, then remove from oven and allow to cool on baking sheet 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, sandwich with chocolate chip cookie dough frosting.
