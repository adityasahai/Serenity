On a lightly floured surface roll the puff pastry out to about 11-inches - press it into a 9-inch deep dish pie pan and fold the edges under. Prick the crust all over with a fork even around the sides. Bake 10 minutes. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray lightly with oil. Lay the bacon out so it's not touching and bake until crispy 10 - 15 minutes. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. When cool enough to handle crumble it up.Meanwhile make little stacks out of the spinach leaves and thinly slice them into ribbons. Melt the cream cheese about 20 seconds in the microwave - it should be soft enough to easily stir. Add it to a large bowl and whisk in the eggs then stir in the spinach leaves. Let it sit 5 - 10 minutes to let the spinach soften a little. Whisk the half & half into the egg mixture then stir in the onion, all three of the remaining cheeses and almost all the bacon, leaving a little to garnish the top. Whisk in a few dashes each of salt and pepper. Pour into the pie crust, sprinkle the top with the remaining bacon and bake about 40 minutes or until the center is set. If the crust starts browning too much cover with foil. Let the quiche set for 10 minutes before cutting. Can be served hot or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
