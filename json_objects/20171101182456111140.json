Mix thoroughly to avoid any flour lumps (this was difficult for me; next time I'll use the mixer). Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator to chill for one hour.Over medium-low heat, warm a non-stick skillet and add a little butter to coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Pour 4 Tablespoons of batter into the pan and quickly swirl the batter around the skillet to form an even, round crepe. I found it best to add the batter to the center of the pan and not around the pan. Cook for 45 seconds, loosening the edges, then flip the crepe and cook for about 15 seconds. Transfer them to a flat surface. Layer parchment paper between each crepe to keep them from sticking together. They should stay warm with each new crepe added or you can place them into a warm oven to hold over like you would pancakes. Fill the crepes with your favorite filling and fold kinda like a burrito or into quarters like I did. Drizzle chocolate syrup on top or add some whipped cream. It's up to you to make them your way. I was happy with them just like this.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix thoroughly to avoid any flour lumps (this was difficult for me; next time I'll use the mixer).","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator to chill for one hour.Over medium-low heat, warm a non-stick skillet and add a little butter to coat the bottom and sides of the skillet.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour 4 Tablespoons of batter into the pan and quickly swirl the batter around the skillet to form an even, round crepe.
