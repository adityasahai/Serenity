Even if you aren't making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if you're eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Banfi Rosa Regale Brachetto. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":433356,"title":"Banfi Rosa Regale Brachetto","description":"Festive cranberry in color with an aromatic bouquet with hints of raspberries, strawberries and rose.
