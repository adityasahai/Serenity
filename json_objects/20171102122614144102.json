Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until butter turns a deep golden color and you see dark flecks. Transfer to a bowl and let cool until no longer warm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Then stir in bourbon and vanilla and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper.In a medium bowl, whisk together almond meal, flour, 1 cup granulated sugar and salt. Make sure there are no lumps from the almond meal. Set aside. In a stand mixer, begin whisking egg whites on medium speed. Once you start to see a white foam form, slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Bump speed up to high and continue beating until stiff white peaks form. Alternately fold the almond mixture & browned butter mixture into the egg whites, a third at a time, starting with the almond mixture & ending with the butter. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until golden & well risen and the center feels firm when pressed. Remove from oven & allow to cool on a wire cooling rack in the pan for 5 minutes. Remove the sides & bottom of the pan and the paper and allow to cool completely on the rack. Serve with fresh fruit (like strawberries) & homemade whipped cream. It is best fresh the first day, but can also be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
