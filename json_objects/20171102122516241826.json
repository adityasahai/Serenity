Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Preheat Oven to 375°F. Oil a sheet pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.Carefully cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the seeds and connecting strands, then place cut side down on the prepared sheet pan.Bake for 45 minutes, or until the squash flesh becomes tender and separates easily into strands with a fork.
