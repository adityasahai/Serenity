Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasional to avoid burning, until crispy (about 10-15 minutes).  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked bacon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess grease.  Set aside.While the bacon is cooking, scramble the eggs.  Melt the butter in a separate large skillet over medium heat.  Beat the eggs in a small bowl, add 2 Tablespoons of cold water and salt and pepper.  Once the butter is melted, swirl the pan so the butter covers the bottom surface.  Pour the eggs into the pan and let cook, while scrambling with a spatula, for 5-8 minutes or until the eggs are cooked through and golden.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Working with one crescent roll package at a time, and leaving the other in the fridge until ready to assemble, remove the dough from the packaging.  Unroll the 8 triangles onto a clean work surface.  Pile about a tablespoon each of the cooked bacon, scrambled eggs, and shredded cheese into the middle of each triangle.  Gently roll the triangle up from the wide end to the skinny end, using your thumbs to keep the filling from spilling out.  Enclose the sides and pinch shut as you roll.Place the filled crescent rolls onto the prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden.  While the first batch is baking, prepare the second batch with the second package of crescent rolls.  Remove from the oven and let set for 2-3 minutes before transferring to a serving platter.  Bake the remaining 8 rolls.  Serve warm.Refrigerate Leftovers:  Once completely cooled, store in an airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days.  Reheat in the microwave or 350 degree oven until heated through.Freeze Leftovers:  Once completely cooled, freeze in a single layer on a parchment lined baking sheet in the freezer for 20 minutes.  Transfer to a freezer bag.
