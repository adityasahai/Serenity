If you need to thin out the mixture, you can add more olive oil or water. I tend to use water just because oil calories add up fast. Once you have reached the right consistency and taste, set aside.If you don't like the taste of raw onions, cook onions until translucent in a bit of oil- 5-6 minutes.In a small bowl, combine chia seeds and water for 30 seconds. Combine with quinoa, onions, salt, and pepper; mix thoroughly. Finally, add the bread crumbs and stir until combined. Let sit for three minutes. If you find your mixture is too soggy to form into patties, add more bread crumbs. If the mixture is too crumbly, add a little water.While mixture sits, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Form patties into a round shape about the size of your palm. Place as many as you can fit in the heated pan and cook on each side until browned, about 5-6 minutes on each side. Repeat with remaining mixture.Once quinoa cakes are done, heat remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Whisk together eggs (one egg per person), and pour into hot pan. I do not add milk and I whisk my eggs up until the time I pour them into the pan. Cook continue to cook and stir until eggs are done.To serve, place a streak of pesto on the plate, followed by eggs, and finally two quinoa patties.If you find you have more mixture than people, save the quinoa mixture and cover it for the next day. Then remove and make your patties right before cooking.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make spinach pesto, combine all ingredients in the food processor and pulse until well combined.
