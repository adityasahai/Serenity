Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try MacMurray Ranch Russian River Pinot Noir.

Stack the tortillas on a large square of foil and wrap them loosely.                                                                                    2                                              Put the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic; sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables soften, 3 to 5 minutes.                                                                                    3                                              Crumble the tofu into the pan with your hands. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet occasionally, and adjusting the heat as necessary, until the tofu browns and crisps as much or as little as you like it, anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.                                                                                    4                                              When the tofu is almost ready, put the tortillas in the oven.                                                                                    5                                              Add the bell pepper to the pan if you’re using it. Sprinkle the mixture with the chili powder; stir, and cook, continuing to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan until the mixture is fragrant, less than a minute. Squeeze the juice of the halved lime over all, garnish with cilantro and scallions, and serve with the tortillas and lime quarters.                                                                                    6                                              More Ideas: For a little more kick without being too fiery, try 1 or 2 poblano chiles instead of the bell pepper.  Substitute 3 cups well-drained cooked or canned black or pinto beans for the tofu. (If you’re using canned beans, rinse them before draining.) Use tempeh instead of tofu. It will be tangier and slightly more dense, closer to the texture of ground meat. Small whole wheat tortillas are good, here, too. Soften them the same way as described above.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oven to 400°F.
