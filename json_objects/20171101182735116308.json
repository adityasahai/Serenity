White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. You could try CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430688,"title":"CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi","description":"Complexity and intensity define this Chardonnay.

Put a drip pan below the grates.                          Mix the ingredients for the Spice Rub until they are well blended. (This will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 week.) Rub it all over the chicken, inside and out.                          Open the beer and take a big swig or just pour out a couple of ounces. Sit the chicken on the beer can so the legs are at the bottom and the wings are at the top. Stand the beer can on the grates over the drip pan. Put the cover on and cook over indirect heat until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. (If using charcoal, push the coals to 1 side so the chicken is not over direct heat.)                          Note: This chicken can also be cooked in a 350 degrees F oven. Just stand the beer can in a shallow roasting pan and cook about 1 hour or until juices run clear.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a gas or charcoal grill with a lid big enough to accommodate the bird.
